# Introduction
**Learning** repository mainly recorded tools and applications tutorial of bioinformatics, usage record of Python, R, Bash command, Shell and methods and principles of data visulization, machine learning, web spider and data analysis in my learning process with my girlfriend.

We roughly classified these records into four categories: `Principle`, `Tutorial`, `Machine Learning` and `Fun Trying`


# 1.BASH
There are `bash shell` records,which includes basic command of `bash shell`, basic grammar of `shell` and advanced skills of `shell` like `sed` and `gawk`. All the useful script are recorded in the above `bash` directory.
