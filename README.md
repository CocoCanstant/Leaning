# Introduction
**Learning** repository mainly recorded tools and applications tutorial of bioinformatics, usage records of Python, R, Shell and methods and principles of data visulization, machine learning, web spider and data analysis in my learning process with my girlfriend.

# 1. The usage of programming language
## 1.1 Bash command and programming
Bash and Shell are often confused in some scenes. But Shell is a generic term used for describing command line interface and scripting environment. It's interoperable UI(**U**ser **I**nterface) of operating system allowing users to run command, manage document, run script and so on. There are various shell types including Bash, zsh, sh, csh, ksh and so on. Bash(Bourne Agine Shell) is one type of shell usually used for Linux system.
