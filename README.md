# Introduction
**Learning** repository mainly recorded tools and applications tutorial of bioinformatics, usage records of Python, R, Bash command, Shell and methods and principles of data visulization, machine learning, web spider and data analysis in my learning process with my girlfriend.

We roughly classified these records into four categories: `Principle`, `Tutorial`, `Machine Learning` and `Fun Trying`. The format of majority of script is jupyter notebook, which ensures the reproducibility of results and figures and reduces the difficulty of reading codes.
