['Pathophysiology of androgen-associated endothelial cell dysfunction in phenotype A polycystic ovarian syndrome revealed by iPSCs modeling', 'Abundant evidence suggests that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased metabolic aberrations and cardiovascular risks and present with signs of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. However, whether and how androgen is involved in the pathogenesis of EC dysfunction in PCOS remains unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were established in two PCOS patients and two control participants and further differentiated into ECs via monoculture under chemically defined conditions. Both PCOS patients were phenotype A (present with oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology) and were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the iPSC-derived ECs revealed functional differences involving the cell cycle process, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and apoptosis between the PCOS and control groups. Decreased expression of cell proliferation and cell cycle related genes were noted in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment significantly enhanced cell proliferation and angiogenic function in the control iPSC-derived ECs. In contrast, significantly deteriorated cell proliferation accompanied with diminished expression of androgen receptor/cyclin-dependent kinase 1/VEGF signaling pathway was shown in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs after DHT treatment, alongside with impaired angiogenesis demonstrated by the tube formation and wound healing assay. In conclusion, disease-specific iPSCs were successfully established in phenotype A PCOS patients with metabolic syndrome and served as an effective platform for disease modeling in this specific subgroup. Both intrinsic and androgen-induced cellular proliferation and angiogenesis were significantly impaired in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs, providing new pathogenic evidence for androgen-mediated EC dysfunction and possibly further cardiovascular consequences.', 'GSE246456', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2023/11/01', 'Immune landscape of PBMC based on single-cell rna sequancing in End Stage Renal Disease', 'Although an increase in studies has revealed the potential mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction during CKD progression, there are still many significant components that need to be clarified, such as the machinery of T-cell phenotype switching and the plasticity levels of different subsets.

We show that the post-RTX B cell landscape is overwhelmingly antigen-inexperienced with minimal transcriptomic differences between relapse and remission.

We show that this nephrotic B cell signature is conferred by the engagement of memory B cells through an extrafollicular developmental route defined by expression of the interfollicular-homing gene GPR183 and the expansion of atypical B cells and marginal zone-like B cells. Moreover, we show that genes involved in APRIL signaling, which promotes extrafollicular antibody-secreting cell development, were substantially upregulated in B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells from INS children.

To date, such studies have focused on titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies, and frequencies of antigen-specific B and T cells. Here, we extend our understanding of the macaque immune response to vaccination with mRNA-1273 with an integrated approach that captures key interactions between the adaptive and innate immune responses. We show that a subset of S-specific T cells are characterized by the expression of key cytokines for activating innate immune responses, including CCL3, IL21, and IFNγ. We also observe an increase in CCR5-expressing intermediate monocytes and a shift of natural killer cells to a more mature cytotoxic phenotype. Antigen-specific B cells are polyclonal but demonstrate preferential usage of specific IGHV genes, and we observe two public clones, one of which matches a widely reported human anti-SARS-CoV-2 public B cell clone. The second vaccine dose elicits an increase in circulating germinal center-like B cells, which are more likely to be clonally expanded and target epitopes on the receptor binding domain. Both vaccine doses stimulate the expression of inflammatory response genes which have previously been associated with elevated antibody responses to a range of vaccines.

We corroborated these hub genes utilizing murine sepsis-ARDS models and blood samples derived from geriatric patients afflicted by sepsis-induced ARDS.Results: Our investigation revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared among COVID-19 and sepsis datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network, unearthing pivotal hub genes and modules. Notably, nine hub genes displayed significant alterations and correlations with critical inflammatory mediators of pulmonary injury in murine septic lungs. Simultaneously, 12 displayed significant changes and correlations with a neutrophil-recruiting chemokine in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. Of these, six hub genes (CD247, CD2, CD40LG, KLRB1, LCN2, RETN) showed significant alterations across COVID-19, sepsis, and geriatric sepsis-induced ARDS. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of hub genes across 3 diverse immune cell types furnished insights into disease pathogenesis. Functional analysis underscored the interconnection between sepsis/sepsis-ARDS and COVID-19, enabling us to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets, transcription factor-gene interactions, DEG-microRNA co-regulatory networks, and prospective drug and chemical compound interactions involving hub genes.Our investigation offers potential therapeutic targets/biomarkers, sheds light on the immune response in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS, emphasizes the association between sepsis/sepsis-ARDS and COVID-19, and proposes novel avenues for targeted therapies.', 'GSE242127', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2023/09/01', 'Preclinical Evidence for the Glucocorticoid-Sparing Potential of a Dual Toll-Like Receptor 7/8 Inhibitor in Autoimmune Diseases', 'Single cell RNA-seq analysis of PBMCs testing for a synergistic effect of TLR7/8 inhibition and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone', 'GSE235927', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2023/09/01', 'Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals immune cell heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukaemia peripheral blood mononuclear cells after chemotherapy', 'Purpose Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the rapid clonal expansion of abnormally differentiated myeloid progenitor cells residing in a complex microenvironment.

In order to explore the immune microenvironment of AML patients after chemotherapy, we conducted this study for providing insights into precision medicine and immunotherapy of AML. Methods In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse the PBMC microenvironment from five AML patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens and six healthy donors. We compared the cell compositions in AML patients and healthy donors, and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), CellPhoneDB, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. Results Using scRNA-seq technology, 91,772 high quality cells of 44,950 PBMCs from AML patients and 46,822 PBMCs from healthy donors were classified as 14 major cell clusters.

Using a new trimodal single cell technology (TEA-seq), we discovered that the composition as well as the transcriptional and epigenetic programming of the naïve T cell compartment in children (11-13 yrs) is distinct from that of older adults (55-65 yrs). Naive CD4 T cells, previously considered relatively resistant to aging, exhibited far more pronounced molecular reprogramming than the CD8 compartment, in which alterations are preferentially driven by shifts in naive-like memory subsets.

Assessing long COVID and immune recovery after Omicron BTIs is crucial for understanding the disease and developing and managing new-generation vaccines. Here, we followed up mild BA.2 BTI convalescents for six-month with routine blood tests and neutralization assay. Then, we applied proteomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the convalescents’ recovery status. Lastly, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical parameters related to immunity and metabolism of the convalescents. We found that major organs exhibited ephemeral dysfunction in double-Convidecia vaccinated persons who experienced BA.2 BTI and recovered to normal in approximately six-month. We observed durable and potent levels of neutralizing antibodies against major circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sub-variants, including BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and BF.7, indicating that hybrid humoral immunity stays active.

However, our understanding of the impact of dysregulated RNA splicing has been hampered by the inability to distinguish mutant and wildtype cells in primary patient samples, the cell-type complexity of the hematopoietic system, and the sparse coverage of splice junctions by short-read sequencing typically used in single-cell RNA sequencing. To overcome these limitations, we developed GoT-Splice by integrating Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) with enhanced efficiency long-read single-cell transcriptome profiling, as well as proteogenomics (with CITE-seq). This allowed for the simultaneous single-cell profiling of gene expression, cell surface protein markers, somatic mutation status, and RNA splicing. We applied GoT-Splice to bone marrow progenitors from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) affected by mutations in the most prevalent mutated RNA splicing factor – the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1. High-resolution mapping of SF3B1mut vs. SF3B1wt hematopoietic progenitors revealed increased fitness advantage of SF3B1mut cells in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, resulting in an expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor (EP) cells. SF3B1mut EP cells exhibited upregulation of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and mRNA translation. Long-read single-cell transcriptomes revealed the previously reported increase of aberrant 3’ splicing site usage in SF3B1mut cells. However, the ability to profile splicing within individual cell populations uncovered distinct cryptic 3’ splice site usage across different progenitor populations, as well as stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid maturation. Lastly, as splice factor mutations occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with increased risk of neoplastic transformation, we applied GoT-Splice to CH samples. These data revealed that the erythroid lineage bias, as well as cell-type specific cryptic 3’ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells, precede overt MDS.

Current diagnostic tests are either unreliable (IgE, skin prick test), or resource-intensive with risks (food challenges). Here we set out to determine if allergen-specific T cells in cow milk allergic (CMA) patients have a distinct quality and/or quantity that could potentially be used as a diagnostic marker. Starting from cow milk extract, we mapped T cell responses to a set of reactive epitopes that we compiled in a peptide pool. This pool induced cytokine responses in in vitro cultured cells distinguishing allergic from non-allergic subjects. Using single-cell RNA and paired TCR sequencing we detected significant changes in the transcriptional program and clonality of cow milk antigen-specific (CM+) T cells elicited by the pool in allergic vs. non-allergic subjects ex vivo. CM+ T cells from allergic subjects had increased percentages of FOXP3+ over FOXP3- cells. FOXP3+ cells are often equated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have suppressive activity, but CM+ FOXP3+ cells from allergic subjects showed significant expression of interferon-responsive genes and dysregulated chemokine receptor expression compared to non-allergic subjects, suggesting that these are not conventional Tregs. The CM+ FOXP3+ cells were also more clonally expanded than the FOXP3- population. We were further able to utilize surface markers (CD25, CD127, CCR7) in combination with our peptide pool stimulation to quantify these CM+ FOXP3+ cells by a simple flow cytometry assay. We show increased percentages of CM+ CD127-CD25+ cells from CMA subjects in an independent cohort, which could be used for diagnostic purposes. Looking specifically for Th2 cells normally associated with allergic diseases, we found a small population of clonally expanded CM+ cells that were significantly increased in CMA subjects and that had high expression of Th2 cytokines and pathogenic Th2/Tfh markers. Overall, these findings suggest that there are several differences in the phenotype of CM+ T cells with CM allergy and that the increase in CM+ FOXP3+ cells is a potential diagnostic marker of an allergic state.

Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important, yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression, and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues, remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), in non-tumor tonsil tissues and in peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with non-tumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically, the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping and in vitro functional assays, corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs.

Patients with clinical responses had tumors enriched in tumor-reactive TILs, preferentially expanding in-vitro to generate larger and more tumoricidal products and preferentially re-infiltrating tumors post-ACT.

We crossed inducible Treg lineage tracker mice (FoxP3-eGFP-Cre-ERT2 ROSA26CAG-fl-stop-fl-tdTomato) to atherosclerosis-prone Apoe -/- mice, sorted Tregs and exTregs from lymph nodes and spleens of replicate mice and determined their transcriptomes by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A support vector machine (SVM) approach identified the leading signature genes for exTregs as CST7, NKG7, GZMA, PRF1, TBX21 and CCL4. Projecting these genes onto feature maps of human PBMC single cell (sc)RNA-Seq with CITE-Seq from 61 subjects with and without atherosclerosis showed that CST7, NKG7, GZMA, PRF1, TBX21 and CCL4 mapped to CD4 T cells that expressed CD56 and CD16. This finding was validated in a second, independent scRNA- and CITE-Seq dataset. Even in healthy volunteers, a subpopulation of CD4 T cells expressed both CD56 and CD16. Bulk RNA-Seq identified these cells as cytotoxic CD4 T cells, which was functionally confirmed in a cell killing assay. DNA sequencing for TCRβ showed clonal expansion of Treg CDR3 sequences in CD16 + CD56 + exTregs.

In vitro, GA significantly promoted differentiation of Lin-CD117+ hematopoietic stem cells toward lymphoid lineages, especially CD8+ T cells. Moreover, GA inhibited differentiation of CD4+ T cells and myeloid (CD11b+) cells by binding to the S100 calcium-binding protein 8 (S100A8). Overexpression of S100A8 in Lin- CD117+ hematopoietic stem cells enhanced cognition in aged mice and in immune reconstited severely immunodeficient B-NDG mice.

A detailed analysis of DC subpopulations using single-cell transcriptomics for the paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of IDD patients (total n = 9) revealed that three subtypes of DCs (ASDCs, ACY3+ DCs, and LAMP3+ DCs) were overrepresented in CSF compared with their paired blood. Among these DCs, ASDCs were also more abundant in CSF of IDD patients than in controls, manifesting poly-adhesional and stimulatory characteristics. In the brain biopsied tissues of IDD patients, obtained at the acute attack of disease, ASDC were also frequently found in close contact with T cells.

To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms driving B cell evolution in response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic, epitope sequencing (CITE-seq), and repertoire profiling of three COVID-19 vaccinees. Spike-specific (S-2P+) B cells showed early immune activation at v1D14 (14 days after vaccine dose 1) and accumulation of somatic hyper mutation (SHM) up to v2M6 (months 6). At v2D6, the S-2P+ cells expanded into memory B cell (MBC) cluster 5 with a dynamic kinetics over time. At v2M6, majority of S-2P+ cells were into resting memory (RM) subset within cluster 5. Analysis of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire showed selection of genes commonly detected in neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Tracking of S-2P+ B cell response showed clonal association between earlier activated CD38+ memory, as well as tissue-like memory, with RM B cells at v2M6. These clones showed evolving signal with progressive accumulation of SHM over time.

Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells, which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues, and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and in contrast to non-LC individuals, exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses.

Therefore, scATAC-seq was performed to generate a high-resolution map of accessible loci in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients at the single-cell level. The purpose of our project was to discover the transcription factors (TFs) that were involved in the pathogenesis of RA at single-cell resolution. In our research, we obtained 22 accessible chromatin patterns. Then, 10 key TFs were involved in the RA pathogenesis by regulating the activity of MAP kinase. Consequently, two genes (PTPRC, SPAG9) regulated by 10 key TFs were found that may be associated with RA disease pathogenesis and these TFs were obviously enriched in RA patients (p<0.05, FC>1.2). With further qPCR validation on PTPRC and SPAG9 in monocytes, we found differential expression of these two genes, which were regulated by eight TFs (ZNF384, HNF1B, DMRTA2, MEF2A, NFE2L1, CREB3L4 (var. 2), FOSL2::JUNB (var. 2), MEF2B).

The increase of peripheral blood (PB) CD8+ T cells expressing CX3CR1, a marker of differentiation, correlates with response to anti-PD-1 therapy; however, the predictive and prognostic value of T-cell CX3CR1 expression during chemo-immunotherapy remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the utility of PB CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. At least 10% increase of the CX3CR1+ subset in circulating CD8+ T cells from baseline (CX3CR1 score) was associated with response to chemo-immunotherapy at 6 weeks (p = 0.0382) and 9 weeks (p = 0.0045). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of at least 10% increase of the CX3CR1 score was 83.3%, 88.2%, 83.3% and 88.2%, respectively with 86.2% overall accuracy of predicting response at 9 weeks.

Combined T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of tumor tissue and single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of longitudinal PB samples from a patient who received a long-term benefit from chemo-immunotherapy demonstrated that circulating clonally expanded CD8+ T cells were terminal effector T cells expressing high levels of CX3CR1, and contained frequent tumor-infiltrating T-cell colonotypes early-on post treatment.

Novel treatments to engage anti-tumor immunity in this setting are needed. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, an innate sensor of cytoplasmic DNA, is a promising target with several agonists in development; however, recent clinical trials of these agents have not demonstrated efficacy for most patients. Here, we present detailed biomarker analyses of a patient with anti-PD-L1 refractory Merkel cell carcinoma that had a durable (~1 year), abscopal response to ADU-S100 (intralesional STING agonist) combined with anti-PD-1 blockade. Methods: Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood acquired pre- and post-treatment were analyzed with single cell RNA sequencing, 27-color flow cytometry, T cell receptor sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC; post treatment tumor specimen only). Critically, cancer-specific CD8 T cells were identified using MHC-I tetramers containing peptides from the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), the etiologic agent of this cancer. Cell lines and tumor specimens from 76 patients were used to evaluate STING expression and signaling in MCC. Results: High levels of antigen cancer-specific T cells were observed in the tumor prior to ADU-S100 treatment (12% of T cells recognized an MCPyV epitope). These cancer-specific CD8 T cells exhibited characteristics of exhaustion including high TOX and low TCF1. Following STING agonist treatment, MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells expanded 3-fold with minimal phenotypic changes. An increase in antigen presentation on MCC tumor cells was also observed (1.8% of tumor cells MHC-I positive before treatment, 8.2% after treatment). This was not a result of ADU-S100 acting directly on tumor cells as mIHC analysis of 88 tumor samples confirmed little or no STING expression in tumor cells, but high STING expression on infiltrating immune and stromal cells. Further in vitro studies showed MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines are STING deficient, and ADU-S100 did not induce interferon. Conclusions: Our study suggests that STING agonists act on intratumoral immune cells to release interferons, which upregulate tumor cell antigen presentation and reinvigorate the anti-tumor response from pre-existing cancer-specific T cells. Thus, patients with anti-PD-(L)1-refractory disease showing downregulation of antigen-presentation may benefit from intralesional STING agonists.', 'GSE227709', 'Homo sapiens', 'Other', '2023/04/01', 'Cancer-specific CD8 T cell frequency at baseline in blood correlates with response to PD-1 blockade in Merkel cell carcinoma.', 'Understanding immunotherapy resistance is challenging due to difficulty identifying cancer-specific T cells.

We characterized cancer-specific T cells in 35 MCC patients, including participants in a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 trial. Higher MCPyV-specific CD8 T-cell frequency in pre-treatment blood (but not tumors) correlated with response (p=0.005). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells in blood had increased stem/memory signatures and decreased exhaustion signatures relative to their intratumoral counterparts. While frequency of peripheral cancer-specific T cells was associated with response to initial PD-(L)1 blockade, longitudinal study of acquired resistance revealed immune evasion by tumor-cell MHC-I downregulation despite cancer-specific T cell expansion to 0.5% in blood.

Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that pALG mainly influenced T cells and innate immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils). By analyzing immune cell subsets, we found that pALG moderately depleted CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, regulatory T cells and NKT cells and mildly inhibited dendritic cells. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6) were only moderately increased compared with rATG, which might be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of untoward immune activation.

In conclusion, pALG acts mainly by moderately depleting T cells and is thus a good candidate for induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients.

However, polyfunctional cytotoxic CD4 T cell responses against both S1 and S2 domains trended higher among convalescent subjects. Multi-modal single-cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse functional programs in spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in both groups. However, convalescent individuals displayed enhanced cytotoxic and antiviral CD8 T cell responses to both S1 and S2 in the absence of cytokine production. Taken together, our data suggest that cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells targeting spike glycoprotein may partially account for hybrid immunity and protection against breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2.', 'GSE223236', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2023/03/01', 'Canine peripheral blood TCRαβ T cell atlas: Identification of diverse subsets including CD8+ MAIT-like cells by combined single-cell transcriptome and V(D)J repertoire analysis', 'The diversity of canine T cells is poorly understood.

Similar immune abnormalities were present in the genetically WT female (F1) but not in male offspring of Het mothers, indicating sex-specific immune system abnormalities that are unrelated to the individual’s receptor expression but instead dependent on the mother’s 5HT1AR deficit, known as a maternal genetic effect or “genetic nurture”. Studying the maternal-fetal interface by scRNA-seq revealed reduced immune cell invasion to the decidua and accelerated trophoblast migration that was normalized by term. Despite these phenotypes, 5HT1AR is not, or only minimally expressed in the immune system and placenta, raising the possibility of a central regulation of the immune system by highly expressed brain receptors.

Here, we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases, identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation, while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore, ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance, while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically, DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1, which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality, whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment.

In vitro, IL6 impaired the differentiation of cDC1s and cDC2s from BM progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human cDC progenitors in the BM and blood of patients with PDAC showed an upregulation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway and a corresponding impairment of antigen processing and presentation.

Fully glycosylated HIV trimer protein is a complex antigen, posing significant immunodominance challenges for B cells.

The aim of this study was to determine if NKT-like cells mobilized during acute cycling exercise could be used to generate more potent anti-tumor CIK cells from healthy donors. An acute exercise bout increased NKT-like cell numbers in blood 2-fold. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that exercise mobilized NKT-like cells have an upregulation of genes and transcriptomic programs associated with enhanced anti-tumor activity, including cytotoxicity, cytokine responsiveness, and migration. Exercise, however, did not augment the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells or alter their surface phenotypes after 21-days of culture.

A limited number of available tools utilize data-driven approach, which may undermine the biological importance of surface protein data. In this study, we developed SECANT, a biology-guided SEmi-supervised method for Clustering, classification, and ANnoTation of single-cell multi-omics. SECANT can be used to analyze CITE-seq data, or jointly analyze CITE-seq and scRNA-seq data.

Besides, as a model-based approach, SECANT can quantify the uncertainty of the results, and our framework can be easily extended to handle other types of multi-omics data.

Despite advances in therapy, novel treatment approaches are needed especially for highly proliferative MCL which has a particularly progressive clinical course even in the era of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase therapy. The sumoylation pathway is known to be upregulated in many cancers including lymphoid malignancies. However, little is currently known about the role of the sumoylation pathway and its oncogenic potential in MCL. We found extensive upregulation of the sumoylation pathway in MCL, particularly at the level of the E1 enzymes SAE1 and SAE2, with elevated expression levels of sumoylation enzyme components showing a worse prognosis and a strong positive correlation with cell cycle associated genes. Targeting the sumoylation pathway with TAK-981, a first in class sumoylation inhibitor currently being investigated in a clinical study of B-cell NHL in combination with rituximab (NCT04074330), resulted in potent loss of sumoylation in MCL cells with significant activity in in-vitro and in vivo models of MCL, including ibrutinib resistance cases. We found mitotic dysregulation to be an important, although not all encompassing mechanism of cell death upon loss of sumoylation of TAK-981 in MCL cells. We uncovered a diverse sumoylation program upon mitosis entry that was significantly reduced with TAK-981. Centromeric localization of the well known sumoylation substrate topoisomeraseIIA (TopIIA) was significantly abrogated upon mitosis entry, likely contributing at least in part to the mitotic dysregulation seen in MCL cells. This mechanism is highly relevant as TopIIA is significantly upregulated in MCL with SAE1/2 overexpression. Our study, in addition to the recently described immunomodulatory activity of TAK-981, not only validates SAE1/2 as a therapeutic target in MCL but also opens the door to further mechanistic work to uncover how to best use desumoylation therapy to treat MCL and other lymphoid malignancies.', 'GSE184031', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2022/09/02', 'Immune challenged SC-islets first response profiled by single cell transcription analysis after co-culture with human allogeneic PBMCs [scRNA-seq_invitro]', 'We performed an in vitro co-culture of allogeneic PBMCs and SC-islet clusters.

Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1, indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1α-XBP1 (4μ8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group.

CD14CTX can directly suppress CD4+ T cells and induce SOCS3 expression in CD4+ T cells rendering them functionally unresponsive.

These responses were further evaluated at the protein level and extended to a total of 53 patients with various cancer types. Unexpectedly, the induction of CD8+ T cell responses associated with cytolytic function was variable and did not predict therapeutic success in this larger patient cohort. Rather, a decrease in the frequency of T cells with a naive-like phenotype was consistently observed after immunotherapy and correlated with prolonged patient survival. In contrast, a more detailed clonotypic analysis of emerging and expanding CD8+ T cells in the blood revealed that a majority of individual T cell clones responding to immunotherapy acquired a transcriptional profile consistent with cytolytic effector function.

The integrative sequencing analyses revealed that BATF, IRF4, NF-κb, and NR4A were important transcription factors for Treg cell differentiation in the TME. Particularly, BATF was identified as a key regulator, which leveraged Treg cell differentiation through epigenetically controlling activation-associated gene expression, resulting in the robustness of Treg cells in the TME.

In HC, aNAV B cells exhibited upregulation of gene signature of germinal center (GC) and classical memory (cMEM) B cells. In contrast, in SLE, aNAV B cells expressed signature genes of aMEM.

Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells that clonally expanded during immunotherapy expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs compared to non-responding cells.

Methods: Sixteen patients with metastatic solid malignancies were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg) daily and nivolumab (240 mg) IV on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycles. Ibrutinib dosing started 7 days before cycle 1 of nivolumab and was given until cycle 1, day 8 of nivolumab.

Methods: We studied ILCs in PBMCs of 51 patients with HCC at baseline and after treatment with ICI. Flow cytometry was used to study ILC composition. Single-cell RNA-sequencing using a targeted panel of 405 immune-related genes was used to characterize the transcriptomic profiles as well as cellular trajectory of ILCs before and after ICI therapy. Intracellular cytokine staining was used to validate ILC function. Data from large patient cohorts were used to predict association with survival. Results: Characterization of the ILC subgroups in PBMCs of HCC patients revealed a significant increase in ILC1 and a decrease in ILC3 frequencies. Single cell RNA-sequencing identified a subgroup of NK-like ILCs which expressed cytotoxicity markers as well as NKp80/KLRF1. This KLRF1high-NK-like population showed low abundance in patients with HCC and was enhanced after combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Trajectory analysis placed this population in between ILC1 and ILC3s. The transcriptomic signature of KLRF1high NK-like ILCs was associated with better progression-free survival in HCC cohorts. Conclusions: We present a previously unknown effect of HCC tumors and ICIs on the composition and plasticity of ILCs in PBMCs.

We previously described a subpopulation of immature Ly6Glow neutrophils that accumulate in the peritoneal cavity 3 days following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the fungal cell wall extract, zymosan. In contrast, conventional, mature Ly6Ghi neutrophils dominate the peritoneal infiltrate 4 hours following i.p. zymosan injection.

However, the lack of specific markers for malignant lymphocytes prevents distinguishing them from benign T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of MF, thus delaying diagnosis and development of specific treatment, which results in poor clinical outcomes. Here we employed recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish the transcriptome of expanded T-cell clones directly in advanced-stage MF skin tumors, allowing the transcriptional profiles of malignant and reactive T lymphocytes to be distinguished. Our analysis identified multiple non-overlapping expanded T-cell clonotypes within individual MF tumors, which included malignant and reactive clones. Heterogeneity among samples was observed not only in the number of expanded clonotypes but also in their TCR specificity and gene expression. While patient-specific tumorigenic pathways were up-regulated by the malignant clones, we also identified a common gene expression that included genes associated with cancer cell metabolism, de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, and invasion. Most non-malignant clones originated from CD8+ T cells and commonly presented an exhausted immune phenotype and activated Th1/Th2 pathways. While non-clonal infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from all tumors shared anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways, patient-specific mechanisms included the TNFR2 signaling cascade, ferroptosis, and cytotoxic pathways by gamma/delta T cells.

However, a subset of HIV-specific T cells, which are capable of simultaneously producing multiple effector cytokines, termed polyfunctional T cells, have correlated with delayed disease progression. HIV-specific polyfunctional T cells have been enumerated and characterized using the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay, which allows for simultaneous multiplexed analysis of cytokine expression at the single-cell level. In addition, using an unbiased computational analysis of ICS data generated through the RV144 HIV vaccine case-control study, we identified vaccine-induced HIV envelope (Env)-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells as a novel correlate of reduced risk of HIV infection. However, very little is known about these cells and what differentiates them from other vaccine-elicited T cells. In addition, the use of sample fixation in the ICS assay prevents those cells from being further interrogated for transcriptional differences. Thus, we developed a novel live-cell multiplexed cytokine capture assay which allows for identification, sorting and transcriptional profiling of individual antigen-specific polyfunctional T cells by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We applied these methods to peripheral blood samples from participants who had received the RV144 vaccine regimen as part of the HVTN 097 clinical trial. Using this approach, we discovered transcriptional signatures that specifically identify the single-cell Env-specific CD4 T-cell functional profiles which had correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection in RV144.

Methods: From September 16 to November 15, 2021, we consecutively enrolled participants aged≥20 years with AIRD who received COVID-19 vaccination. The level of serum IgG antibodies to the SARS-Cov-2 receptor-binding domain on the spike protein S1 subunit was quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. The immunogenicity and adverse reactions between ChAdOx1 nCov-19/AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 were compared.

On the one hand, these terms may relate to temporality within the immune response : “effector” indicates the acute phase, “memory” refers to the post-contraction, resting phase. On the other hand, the terms also assign prototypic differentiation phenotypes that may be found at the same time-point : memory or effector subsets, based on characteristic markers. In this study, we analyse the human CD8 T cell response to YF-17D vaccination as the best-known model of acute immune response in humans. We study 21 characteristic markers conventionally used in mice and in humans to analyse and describe differentiation, activation, cycling, and so-called effector functions such as cytokine production and degranulation. We find clearly distinct ‘acute traits’ at the peak of the response that are shared amongst all non-naïve antigen-specific subsets, including in memory phenotype cells. These acute traits were low BCL-2 and high Ki67, CD38, HLA- DR, as well as increased Granzyme B and Perforin, which have been previously attributed only to effector cells at the peak of the response.

Methods: We cultured PBMCs obtained both before and at one-year after initiating SLIT and used a combination of single-cell RNA sequence and repertoire sequencing. To investigate biomarkers, we used PBMCs from patients participating a phase II/III trial of SLIT tablets for JCP and PBMCs from good and poor responders in outpatients. Results: Antigen-stimulated culturing after SLIT led to clonal expansion of Th2 and Treg cells, and most of these CD4+ T cells retained their CDR3 regions before and after treatment, indicating antigen-specific clonal responses and differentiation secondary to SLIT. However, SLIT reduced the number of clonal functional Th2 cells but increased the Trans-type Th2 cell population that expresses musculin (MSC), TGF-β, and IL-2. Trajectory analysis suggested that SLIT induced clonal differentiation of the Trans-type Th2 cells differentiated into Treg cells. By using real-time PCR, we found that MSC levels increased after 1 year of treatment in the active SLIT group and good responders. Conclusion: The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire analysis helped reveal a part of the underlying mechanism— that SLIT promotes the expression of MSC on pathogenic Th2 cells and suppresses their function, and that MSC may be a potential biomarker of SLIT for allergic rhinitis.

Methods: We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4hr, 24hr, 72hr post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness. Findings: Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness.

Transcription factor expression analysis further highlighted transcriptional differences between decidual MAIT cells and non-matched peripheral MAIT cells. Functionally, MAIT cells are skewed towards IFNg and TNFa production upon stimulation, with E. coli leading to IFNg production.

A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits, P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in latently infected memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability for proviral transcription are not well-defined. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we sought to identify specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb, defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Unexpectedly, cellular treatment with diacylglycerol-mimicking protein kinase C (PKC) agonists in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore was sufficient to stimulate active P-TEFb expression and reactivate latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that of the four known isoforms of RasGRP, the diacylglycerol-dependent Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed isoform in memory CD4+ T cells and should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2 pathway alongside the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and strongly suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore, contrary to prevailing models, the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells in response to either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is largely independent of PKC activity but rather primarily involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade namely RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2.', 'GSE167916', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2021/09/07', 'Inhibition of MET Signaling with Ficlatuzumab in Combination with Chemotherapy in Refractory AML: Clinical Outcomes and High-Dimensional Analysis', 'Acute myeloid leukemia patients refractory to induction therapy or relapsed within one year have poor outcomes.

Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed, and 20 mg/kg was established as the recommended phase II dose. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was febrile neutropenia. Among 17 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 53%, all complete remissions. Phospho-proteomic mass cytometry showed potent on-target suppression of p-MET after ficlatuzumab and that attenuation of p-S6 was associated with clinical response. Multiplexed single cell RNA sequencing using longitudinally collected patient specimens identified interferon and MYC target genes as adverse predictive factors. The ficlatuzumab and cytarabine combination is well-tolerated with favorable efficacy.

The absence of single-cell investigations into the broader population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PBMCs from a strictly matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19, eight patients with CAP, and four non-infectious control subjects.

We compared the peripheral blood cellular and humoral immune responses during Pf malaria infection between clinically susceptible and protected participants from a malaria endemic region in Malawi during a prospective 18-month longitudinal study. Participant classifications were defined by the number of recurrent clinical malaria episodes with susceptible participants having more than three while protected less than one episode during the study period.

Using high dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and spectral flow cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identified expanded memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes in the blood of protected participants undergoing malaria infection. These cells express a strong cytolytic T helper 1 effector program with transcripts encoding granzymes (A, B, H, M), granulysin, NKG7 and the ZEB2 master transcriptional regulator of terminally differentiated effector T cells. ZEB2+ memory CD4+ T cells were CD39hiTIGIThi and expressed multiple chemotactic and inhibitory receptors.

Using integrated epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we demonstrated a novel action of CDK4/6 inhibitors in promoting the phenotypic and functional acquisition of immunological T cell memory. Short-term priming with a CDK4/6 inhibitor promoted long-term endogenous anti-tumor T cell immunity in mice, enhanced the persistence and therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, and induced an RB-dependent T cell phenotype supportive of favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma patients.

Detecting multiplets in snATAC-seq data is particularly challenging due to data sparsity and limited dynamic range (0 reads: closed chromatin, 1: open on in one parental chromosome allele, 2: open on in both alleles chromosomes). Yet, these unique data features offer an opportunity to identify multiplets. ATAC-DoubletDetector (https://ucarlab.github.io/ATAC-DoubletDetector/) AMULET (Atac MULtiplet Estimation Tool) exploits these unique features to detect multiplets by studying enumerates the number of regions with >2 uniquely aligned reads across the genome to effectively detect multiplets - an effective alternative to methods based on artificially-generated multiplets. We evaluated the method by generating snATAC-seq data (e.g., state-of-the-art ArchR). For benchmarking we generated snATAC-seq data and generated data fromeasured the efficacy of AMULET inm in two primary human tissues: peripheral human blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pancreatic islet samples. AMULET detects had high multiplets with an estimated precision (estimated via donor-based multiplexing) and high recall (estimated via simulated doublets) compared to alternatives 0.57 precision and achieves 0.85 recall. When and was the most effective when a certain read depth is achieved (a certain read depth per nucleus is achieved samples are sequenced deeply (e.g., median read count per nucleus >20K25K) reads per nucleus in PBMCs), ATAC-DoubletDetector captured 85% of simulated doublets (i.e., recall), significantly outperforming ArchR (24%). For lower read depth, ATAC-DoubletDetector and ArchR produced complementary results. Moreover, ATAC-DoubletDetector was equally effective in identifying homotypic multiplets (i.e., multiplets from the same cell type), which are missed by simulation-based methods. Cell-specific marker peaks enabled accurate (85%) tracing of cellular origins of snATAC-seq multiplets. Accordingly, more abundant cells within a tissue are more likely to form multiplets and the majority of multiplets are homotypic.

PD-1 blockade “unleashes” CD8 T cells, including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumor microenvironment can inhibit responses by dampening MANA-specific T cell function. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics are revealing global T cell dysfunction programs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the vast majority of TIL do not recognize tumor antigens and little is known about transcriptional programs of true MANA-specific TIL. Here, we use an integrated approach to identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells (MANAFEST) assay in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers and use their TCR CDR3 as barcodes to track them and analyze their transcriptional programs and function in the tumor microenvironment using single cell RNA sequencing. We find both MANA-and virus-specific clones in TIL and adjacent normal lung, regardless of response status. MANA-specific, influenza (flu)-specific and EBV-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Most MANA-specific clones are tissue resident memory (TRM) cells, an incompletely activated cytolytic program, including EOMES deficiency, and higher levels of genes encoding T cell inhibitory molecules and Tox2. Notably, MANA-specific T cells express low levels of IL-7R and are functionally less responsive to IL-7 compared with tissue-resident flu-specific clones. MANA-specific clones from anti-PD-1 non-responding tumors express TCR with markedly lower ligand-dependent signaling capability, are largely confined to HOBIThi TRM subsets and coordinately up-regulate genes encoding specific checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors, and intracellular inhibitors of T cell activation and cytotoxicity.

Thus, EqHV studies are important to understand equine liver disease, and further as an outbred surrogate animal model for HCV pathogenesis and protective immune responses. Here, we aimed to characterize the course of EqHV infection and associated protective immune responses. Approach & Results: Seven horses were experimentally inoculated with EqHV, monitored for 6 months, and rechallenged with the same, and subsequently a heterologous EqHV. Clearance was the primary outcome (6 of 7) and was associated with subclinical hepatitis characterized by lymphocytic infiltrate and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Seroconversion was delayed and antibody titers waned slowly. Clearance of primary infection conferred non-sterilizing immunity resulting in shortened duration of viremia after rechallenge. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses in horses were minimal, although EqHV specific T cells were identified. Additionally, an interferon stimulated gene signature was detected in the liver during EqHV infection, similar to acute HCV in humans. EqHV, as HCV, is stimulated by direct binding of the liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. Interestingly, we found that EqHV infection sequesters enough miR-122 to functionally affect gene regulation in the liver. This RNA-based mechanism thus could have consequences for pathology. Conclusions: EqHV infection in horses typically has an acute resolving course, and the protective immune response lasts for at least a year and broadly attenuates subsequent infections. This could have important implications to achieve the primary goal of an HCV vaccine; to prevent chronicity while accepting acute resolving infection after virus exposure.', 'GSE167260', 'Equus caballus', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2021/06/01', 'Gene-regulatory network analysis of systemic lupus erythermatosus with a single-cell chromatin accessible assay', 'Systemic lupus erythermatosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease, and epigenetic study is promissing for illustrating the mechanisms of SLE pathogenesis.

Our objective was to Characterize a model of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with severe asthma (SA) and its response to the TLR3 agonist Poly I:C using two single-cell methods. Methods: Two complementary single-cell methods, DropSeq for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), were used to profile PBMCs of SA patients and healthy controls (HC). Poly I:C-stimulated and unstimulated cells were analyzed in this study. Results: PBMCs (n=9,414) from five SA (n=6,099) and three HC (n=3,315) were profiled using scRNA-Seq. Six main cell subsets, namely CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes, were identified. CD4+ T cells were the main cell type in SA and demonstrated a pro-inflammatory profile characterized by increased JAK1 expression. Following Poly I:C stimulation, PBMCs from SA had a robust induction of interferon pathways compared with HC. CyTOF profiling of Poly I:C stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs (n=160,000) from the same individuals (SA=5; HC=3) demonstrated higher CD8+ and CD8+ effector T cells in SA at baseline, followed by a decrease of CD8+ effector T cells after poly I:C stimulation. Conclusions: Single-cell profiling of an in vitro model using PBMCs in patients with SA identified activation of pro-inflammatory pathways at baseline and strong response to Poly I:C, as well as quantitative changes in CD8+ effector cells.

In conclusion, this pilot study provides the first single-cell results with a repeated measures design in sepsis to analyze the temporal changes in the immune cell population behavior in surviving or fatal sepsis. These findings indicate that tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell-types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes.

Here we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood brain barrier. Methods: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA-sequencing we localize these cells in post-mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes). Findings: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/LTB+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Conclusions: As a consequence, we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression.

In vivo HMA treatment promotes CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and supresses tumor growth via CD8+ T-cell dependent activity. HMAs enhances primary human CD8+ T-cells activation markers, effector cytokine production, and anti-tumor cytolytic activity. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling shows that HMAs vastly regulate T-cell activation related transcriptional networks, culminating with over-activation of NFATc1 short-isoforms.

Identifying and characterizing immune cells in such organisms is frequently limited by the availability of species-reactive immunophenotyping reagents for flow cytometry, and insufficient prior knowledge of cell type-defining markers. Here, we demonstrate the utility of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to characterize immune cells for which traditional experimental tools are limiting. Specifically, we used scRNA-Seq to comprehensively define the cellular diversity of equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy horses across different breeds, ages, and sexes. We identified 30 cell type clusters partitioned into five major populations: Monocytes/Dendritic Cells, B cells, CD3+PRF1+ lymphocytes, CD3+PRF1- lymphocytes, and Basophils. Comparative analyses revealed many analogous cell populations in human PBMC, including transcriptionally heterogeneous monocytes and distinct dendritic cell subsets (cDC1, cDC2, plasmacytoid DC). Unexpectedly, we found that a majority of the equine peripheral B cell compartment is comprised of T-bet+ B cells; an immune cell subpopulation typically associated with chronic infection and inflammation in human and mouse.

Bioinformatic analysis of the 57,676 single cell transcriptomes showed the CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells, with the cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor, and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of the underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature, with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion.

They display a strong activated and cytotoxic phenotype that is more pronounced in lungs. Blood MAIT cell alterations positively correlate with other innate cell activation; pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-18; and with the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified a monocyte/macrophage Interferon-a-IL-18 cytokine shift and the ability of infected macrophages to induce cytotoxicity of MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner.

We investigated such resistance mechanisms in relapsed / refractory early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying activating NOTCH1 mutations, by full-length single cell RNA sequencing of malignant and microenvironmental cells. We identified two highly distinct stem-like states that critically differ in their cell-cycle and oncogenic signaling. Fast-cycling stem-like leukemia cells demonstrate Notch activation and are effectively eliminated in patients by Notch inhibition, while slow cycling stem-like cells are Notch-independent but rather rely on PI3K signaling, likely explaining the poor efficacy of Notch inhibition in this disease. Remarkably, we find that both stem-like states can differentiate into a more mature leukemia state with prominent immune-modulatory functions, including high expression of the LGALS9 checkpoint molecule. These cells promote an immunosuppressive leukemia ecosystem with clonal accumulation of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that express HAVCR2, the cognate receptor for LGALS9. Our study identifies complex interactions between signaling programs, cellular plasticity and immune programs that characterize T-ALL and illustrates the multi-dimensionality of tumor heterogeneity.

To bridge this knowledge gap, we performed scRNAseq analysis on longitudinally collected PBMC samples obtained from 3 individuals (8 time points per subject) enrolled in the SUNY/WRAIR DENV-1 controlled human challenge study.

In mice, the greatest changes in gene expression were seen in monocytes across both compartments. After systemic injury, the gene expression pattern of monocytes markedly deviated from steady state with corresponding changes in critical transcription factors (TFs), which can be traced back to myeloid progenitors. These changes were largely recapitulated in the human single-cell analysis. We generalized the major changes in human CD14+ monocytes into six signatures, which further defined two trauma patient subtypes (SG1 vs. SG2) identified in the whole blood leukocyte transcriptome in the initial 12h after injury. Compared with SG2, SG1 patients exhibited delayed recovery, more severe organ dysfunction and a higher incidence of infection and non-infectious complications.

Following unbiased clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified for 18 cell types and bioinformatically assessed for function and pathway enrichment. Our results reveal persistent activation of circulating classical monocytes with subsequent upregulation of trafficking molecules. Specifically, classical monocytes upregulated distinct markers of activation including adhesion molecules, pattern recognition receptors, and chemokine receptors, as well as enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways HMGB1, mTOR, and ephrin receptor signaling. Predictive modeling implicated TGFβ and mTOR signaling as drivers of persistent monocyte activation. Additionally, sarcoidosis T cell subsets displayed patterns of dysregulation. CD4 naïve T cells were enriched for markers of apoptosis and Th17/Treg differentiation, while effector T cells showed enrichment of anergy-related pathways. Differentially expressed genes in regulatory T cells suggested dysfunctional p53, cell death, and TNFR2 signaling.

Here, we employed an advanced single-cell RNA sequencing technology to systematically analyze 11259 human circulating monocytes and genetically defined their subpopulations. We constructed a precise atlas of human blood monocytes，identified 6 subpopulations: including S100A12-; HLA-; CD16-; proinflammatory-; megakaryocyte-like-; and NK-like-monocytes subsets, and uncovered 2 previously unidentified subsets: HLA- and megakaryocyte-like monocyte subsets. Relative to healthy individuals, cellular composition, gene expression signatures, and activation states were markedly alternated in VKH patients utilizing cell type-specific programs, especially the CD16- and proinflammatory monocyte subpopulation. Notably, we discovered a disease-relevant subgroup, proinflammatory monocytes, which showed a discriminative gene expression signature indicative of inflammation, antiviral activity, and pathologic activation, and converted into pathologic activation state implicating the active inflammation during VKH disease. Additionally, we found the cell type-specific transcriptional signature of proinflammatory monocytes, ISG15, which could act as a disease biomarker to more accurately reflect disease activity and treatment response than symptom evaluation.

Currently, the main sources of macrophages used in drug development are still primary cells isolated from blood or tissue, or immortalized cell lines (e.g. THP-1).

For this, iPSC-derived macrophages are thoroughly characterized to confirm their cell identity and thus their suitability for screening purposes. We demonstrate that this method to generate macrophages from iPSC overcomes the limitations of using primary cells, i.e. donor variability and limited availability of large cell numbers.

Here we present a multi-omics approach allowing the simultaneous targeted quantification of mRNA and protein expression in single-cells and investigate its performance to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations. Methods: We have quantified the single-cell expression of 397 genes at the mRNA level and up to 68 proteins using oligo-conjugated antibodies (AbSeq) in 43,656 primary CD4+ T cells isolated from blood and 31,907 CD45+ cells isolated from blood and matched duodenal biopsies. We explored the sensitivity of this targeted scRNA-seq approach to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations and identify trajectories of functional T-cell differentiation. Results: We provide a high-resolution map of human primary CD4+ T cells, and identify precise trajectories of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation in blood and tissue. The sensitivity provided by this multi-omics approach identified the expression of the B7 molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of CD4+ Tregs, and we further demonstrated that B7 expression has the potential to identify recently activated T cells in circulation. Moreover, we identified a rare subset of CCR9+ T cells in blood with gut-homing properties and expression of several immunomodulatory receptors, suggestive of a regulatory function at barrier sites.

We developed a high-throughput experimental and computational pipeline and demonstrated the potential of Prox-Seq for multi-omic analysis with a panel of 13 proximity probes, enabling the measurement of 91 protein complexes, along with thousands of mRNA molecules in single T cells and B cells. Prox-seq is compatible with current single-cell RNA sequencing assays, such as Drop-seq and Smart-seq2.

SEC61A1 encodes the α subunit of the heterotrimeric SEC61 complex, which governs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptide-dependent protein transport and passive calcium leakage. Recently, autosomal dominant mutations in SEC61A1 were reported to be pathogenic in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and glomerulocystic kidney disease. However the full spectrum of clinical manifestations in SEC61A1 mutations is yet to be explored. We investigated a SCN patient, the only child of healthy non-consanguineous Belgian parents. We identified a de novo private missense mutation in SEC61A1 (c.A275G;p.Q92R; CADD 24.5; msc 6.099) in the patient. The mutation results in diminished expression of the protein in PBMC and fibroblasts, and an increase in calcium leakage from the ER. In vitro differentiation of CD34+ cells recapitulated the patient’s clinical arrest in granulopoiesis. The impact of Q92R-SEC61α1 on neutrophil maturation was validated using HL-60 cells, where transduction reduced differentiation into CD11b+CD16+ cells. A potential mechanism for this defect is the uncontrolled initiation of the unfolded protein stress response (UPR), with single-cell analysis of primary bone-marrow revealing perturbed UPR in myeloid precursors, and in vitro differentiation of primary CD34+ cells into neutrophils revealing upregulation of the pro-apoptotic CHOP and BiP UPR-response genes.

However, clinical translation has proven difficult. Here, we hypothesized that one reason could be that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood are different from those in the arthritic joint. Methods: We performed meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data from synovium, whole blood cells (WBC), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T cells from patients with RA and healthy control in order to identify overlapping pathways, predicted upstream regulators and potential biomarkers. We also analyzed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral blood and whole joints from a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis. Results: Analyses of two profiling data sets from synovium from RA patients and healthy controls all showed significant activation of pathways of known pathogenic relevance, such as Th1 pathway, role of NFAT in regulation of the immune response, dendritic cell maturation, iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, Fc? receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon signaling, Cdc42 signaling, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis. The most activated upstream regulators included TNF, an important drug target, as well as IFN-gamma and CD40LG, all of which are known to play important pathogenic roles in RA. The differentially expressed genes from synovium included several potential biomarkers, such as CCL5, CCL13, CCL18, CX3CL1, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, IL15, IL32, IL1RN, SPP1, and TNFSF11. By contrast, microarray studies of WBC, PBMC and CD4 + T cells showed variable pathways and limited pathway overlap with synovium. Similarly, scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis did not support that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood reflect those in the arthritic joints. These data showed pathway overlap between mouse joint cells and synovium from patients with RA, but not with cells in peripheral blood. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a dichotomy between gene expression changes, pathways, upstream regulators and biomarkers in synovium and cell types in peripheral blood, which complicates identification of biomarkers in blood.', 'GSE141105', 'Mus musculus', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2020/01/10', 'Inference and effects of barcode multiplets in droplet-based single-cell assays', 'A widespread assumption for single-cell analyses specifies that one cell’s nucleic acids are predominantly captured by one oligonucleotide barcode.

We demonstrate that barcode multiplets can be derived from at least two different sources. First, we confirm that\xa0 approximately 4% of droplets from the 10x platform may contain multiple beads. Additionally, we find that approximately 5% of beads may contain detectable levels of multiple oligonucleotide barcodes.

A new analytical approach, named cell set enrichment analysis (CSEA) identified a cluster-independent increase of follicular T helper (TFH) cells potentially driving the known expansion of B lineage cells in the CSF in MS.

Here, we built register-specific insulin MHC tetramers, Ins12-20 and Ins13-21, to examine anti-insulin CD4 T cell responses during the early pre-diabetic phase of disease in mice. A single cell gene expression analysis and single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of anti-insulin CD4 T cells performed in 6 and 12-week-old NOD mice, revealed tissue-specific gene expression signatures. TCR signaling and clonal expansion were found only in the islets of Langerhans. and produced either classical Th1 differentiation or an unusual Treg phenotype, independent of TCR usage. The early phase of the anti-insulin response was dominated by cells specific for Ins12-20, the register that supports a P9 switch mode of recognition. The presence of the switch was demonstrated by TCR sequencing, re-expression, mutagenesis, and functional testing of alpha/beta TCR pairs in vitro. The genetic correction of the beta57 mutation resulted in the disappearance of D/E residues in the CDR3beta of anti-Ins12-20 T cells, and inability of cells normally activated by a switch to recognize the Ins9-23 peptide.

Derived from >100 diverse human surgically resected tumor samples or from murine tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, PDOs preserved cancer histologic subtypes and mutational spectrum with endogenous T, B, NK cells and macrophages integrally embedded amidst the tumor epithelium. PDO-based TILs accurately recapitulated the T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum of the original tumors, as determined by a robust droplet-based immune profiling solution that links gene expression and immune repertoire in single cells. Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment of organoids from murine tumors from syngeneic immunocompetent hosts induced activation and cytolytic activity of tumor antigen-specific TILs, indicating successful PDO modeling of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-tumor immunity. Crucially, the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab activated TILs in PDOs from human lung, renal and melanoma clinical tumor resections. The organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with its endogenous immune stroma should facilitate mechanistic investigation of TME-specific local tumor immunity, with applications for functional testing of individualized patient immunotherapy responses.', 'GSE111360', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other', '2018/12/13', 'Single cell dissection of plasma cell heterogeneity in symptomatic and asymptomatic myeloma', 'Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell (PC) malignancy, is the second most common blood cancer.

In almost all reported works, investigators have used live cells which represent several inconveniences and limitations. Some recent cell fixation methods did not work with most primary cells including immune cells. Methods: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve PBMCs for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10X Chromium platform. Results: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to three-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3X saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3X SSC were successfully implemented into 10X Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs.

Upon cross-species transmission, AlHV-1 induces an acute and fatal lymphoproliferative disease named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in many ruminants, including cattle and the rabbit model. Latency has been shown to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms causing the activation and proliferation of infected CD8+ T cells are unknown. Many γ-HVs express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small noncoding RNAs can suppress host or viral target genes involved in various pathways and are thought to facilitate viral infection and/or mediate activation and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. AlHV-1 genome has been predicted to encode a large number of miRNAs. However, their precise contribution in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo remains unknown. Here, we have cloned small RNAs and sequenced 36 potential miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing MCF. Among the sequenced candidate miRNAs, 32 were expressed on the reverse strand of the genome in two main clusters. The expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further validated using Northern blot and qRT-PCR in lymphoid organs of MCF-developing calves or rabbits. To determine the concerted contribution in MCF of 28 viral miRNAs clustered in the non-protein-coding region of the AlHV-1 genome, a recombinant virus was produced. The absence of these 28 miRNAs did not affect viral growth in vitro nor MCF induction in rabbits, demonstrating that AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in the non-protein-coding genomic region are not essential for MCF induction.', 'GSE71056', 'Bos taurus', 'Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing', '2015/08/27', 'A PBMC Transcriptional Module Related to Vascular Function', 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including rare circulating stem and progenitor cells (CSPCs), have important yet poorly understood roles in the maintenance and repair of blood vessels and perfused organs. Our hypothesis was that the identities and functions of CSPCs in cardiovascular health could be ascertained by analyzing the patterns of their co-expressed markers in unselected PBMC samples. Because gene microarrays had failed to detect many stem cell-associated genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the expression of 45 primitive and tissue differentiation markers in PBMCs from healthy and hypertensive human subjects. We compared these expression levels to the subjects’ demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, including vascular stiffness. The tested marker genes were expressed in all of samples and organized in hierarchical transcriptional network modules. An index of gene expression in one of these modules (metagene), defined as the average standardized relative copy numbers of 15 pluripotency and cardiovascular differentiation markers, was negatively correlated (all p<0.03) with age (R2=-0.23), vascular stiffness (R2=-0.24), and central aortic pressure (R2=-0.19) and positively correlated with body mass index (R2=0.72, in women). The co-expression of three neovascular markers was validated at the single-cell level using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The overall gene expression in this cardiovascular module was reduced by 72±22% in the patients compared with controls. However, the compactness of both modules was increased in the patients’ samples, which was reflected in reduced dispersion of their nodes’ degrees of connectivity, suggesting a more primitive character of the patients’ CSPCs. In conclusion, our results show that the relationship between CSPCs and vascular function is encoded in modules of the PBMCs transcriptional network. Furthermore, the coordinated gene expression in these modules can be linked to cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease; thus, this measure may be useful for their diagnosis and prognosis.', 'GSE56327', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by RT-PCR', '2014/07/21', 'Induction of pluripotency in human somatic cells via a primitive streak-like state', 'During mammalian embryonic development, the primitive streak is initiates the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells into germ layers. Pluripotency can be reacquired in committed somatic cells using a combination of handful transcription factors, such as OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (hereafter referred to as OSKM), albeit with low efficiency . Here we show that, during the OSKM-induced reprogramming process toward pluripotency in human cells, intermediate cells transiently show gene expression profiles resembling mesendoderm, which is a major component of the primitive streak. Based on these findings, we discover that forkhead box H1 (FOXH1), a transcription factor required for anterior primitive streak specification during early development, significantly enhances the reprogramming efficiency of human fibroblasts by promoting their maturation, including the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and the activation of late pluripotent markers. These results demonstrate that during the reprogramming process, human somatic cells go through a transient state that resembles mesendoderm.', 'GSE50206', 'Homo sapiens; Mus musculus', 'Expression profiling by array', '2014/04/24', 'Comparison of haploid and diploid clones of KBM7 cancer cell line', 'The series were performed to study the changes in gene expression upon diploidization of KBM7 cancer (CML) cell line.

In lymphatic tissues, CLL cells are interspersed with CD68+ nurselike cells (NLC) and T cells. However, the mechanism regulating co-localization of CLL cells and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross-talk between CLL and NLC, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after co-culture with NLC. NLC co-culture induced high-level expression of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and two chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. Supernatants from CLL-NLC co-cultures revealed high CCL3/CCL4 protein levels. B cell receptor triggering also induced a robust induction of CCL3 and CCL4 expression by CLL cells, which was almost completely abrogated by a specific Syc inhibitor, R406. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that activation of this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross-talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment, namely the secretion of two T cell chemokines by CLL-NLC interaction and in response to BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines, CLL cells can recruit accessory cells, and thereby actively create a microenvironment that favors their growth and survival.', 'GSE13811', 'Homo sapiens', 'Expression profiling by array', '2008/12/11', 'Genetic alteration in recurrent melanoma', 'It is generally accepted that human cancers derive from a mutated single cell. However, the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with heterologous ones and correlated array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed on autologous cell lines and heterologous melanoma cell lines originated from other patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances, global transcriptional patterns and cellular phenotypes; they did not follow a strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis; although their contribution was intertwined, genomic imbalances detectable by aCGH contributed only 25% of the transcriptional traits determining autologous tumors distinctiveness. Our study provides important insights about the dynamics of cancer progression and supports the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies against stable genetic factors determining the individuality of each patient’s disease that are maintained throughout the end stage of disease.

STAT5a phosphorylation induces the transcriptional up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes specifically in TCM. The phosphorylation of FOXO3a at S315, following TCR engagement, prevents the transcription of pro-apoptotic gene like FasL and BIM. Experiments aimed at blocking FOXO3a phosphorylation confirmed the role of FOXO3a in protecting TCM from apoptosis.
