Factors contributing to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy efficacy in pediatric oncology patients,Immune cell populations are composed of multiple cell types and their functions are tightly connected through their interactions. Cancer immunotherapy enhances the immune system’s ability to recognize and fight cancer and diminish cancer’s ability to evade the immune system. In Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy__ T-cells are engineered to eliminate cancer cells by targeting cell surface markers. Problems with CAR-T therapy include relapse due to loss of persistence of CAR-T cells and loss of CD19 expression on leukemia cells. The mechanisms of CAR-T failure need to be elucidated and exploring these mechanisms will identify potential treatment options and improve outcomes. Utilizing single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq)__ we investigated the interactions between CAR-T cells and the immune cells in pediatric ALL patients who’ve received CAR-T therapy. We analyzed the lymphocyte composition and gene expression profile at different time-points of ALL patients through CAR-T cell therapy. We have compared this data in responders with relapse patients after CAR-T infusion. Focusing on significantly altered immune cell populations and their gene markers__ we employ in vitro and in vivo models to validate their function.,GSE187438,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/11/02
Pathophysiology of androgen-associated endothelial cell dysfunction in phenotype A polycystic ovarian syndrome revealed by iPSCs modeling,Abundant evidence suggests that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased metabolic aberrations and cardiovascular risks and present with signs of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. However__ whether and how androgen is involved in the pathogenesis of EC dysfunction in PCOS remains unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were established in two PCOS patients and two control participants and further differentiated into ECs via monoculture under chemically defined conditions. Both PCOS patients were phenotype A (present with oligomenorrhea__ hyperandrogenism__ and polycystic ovarian morphology) and were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the iPSC-derived ECs revealed functional differences involving the cell cycle process__ vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and apoptosis between the PCOS and control groups. Decreased expression of cell proliferation and cell cycle related genes were noted in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment significantly enhanced cell proliferation and angiogenic function in the control iPSC-derived ECs. In contrast__ significantly deteriorated cell proliferation accompanied with diminished expression of androgen receptor/cyclin-dependent kinase 1/VEGF signaling pathway was shown in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs after DHT treatment__ alongside with impaired angiogenesis demonstrated by the tube formation and wound healing assay. In conclusion__ disease-specific iPSCs were successfully established in phenotype A PCOS patients with metabolic syndrome and served as an effective platform for disease modeling in this specific subgroup. Both intrinsic and androgen-induced cellular proliferation and angiogenesis were significantly impaired in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs__ providing new pathogenic evidence for androgen-mediated EC dysfunction and possibly further cardiovascular consequences.,GSE246456,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/11/01
Immune landscape of PBMC based on single-cell rna sequancing in End Stage Renal Disease,Although an increase in studies has revealed the potential mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction during CKD progression__ there are still many significant components that need to be clarified__ such as the machinery of T-cell phenotype switching and the plasticity levels of different subsets. Fortunately__ in the last decade__ novel technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled us to investigate transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell level and have enabled us to unravel the potential mechanisms of the heterogeneity of the cell phenotype underlying different diseases. In this study__ we investigated the immune cell composition__ function__ and interaction with other cells in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) during the ESRD period__ especially CD4+ T-cell plasticity and the involved signaling pathways and mediators__ which could be potential therapeutic targets for preventing CKD progression and complications.,GSE233315,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/31
Gene expression profile at single cell level of human T cells stimulated via antibodies against the T Cell Receptor (TCR),We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to compare gene expression in human T cells following stimulation with antibodies directed against a CD3 subunit (CD3ε) versus the TCRβ chain variable (V) domain,GSE229626,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/31
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with active idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) and healthy controls (HC) [RTXrel_vs_RTXrem],An autoimmune B cell origin for childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is predicted based on the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) at maintaining long-term remission from proteinuria. Knowledge regarding the nature of the culprit B cell response is very limited. In particular__ no transcriptomics work has been performed to evaluate the B cell response in INS. Here__ we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on B cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from four children with INS during the B cell recovery phase of a previous RTX treamtent while in remission or relapse (paired relapse-remisison samples). We show that the post-RTX B cell landscape is overwhelmingly antigen-inexperienced with minimal transcriptomic differences between relapse and remission. However__ post-RTX relapses were associated with an early resurgence of an extrafollicular B cell population expressing genes associated with marginal zone B cells (MZB1__ CD24__ IGHM__ CD1C__ TNFRSF13B__ GPR183). Together__ our study provides evidence for an extrafollicular origin for humoral immunity in active INS.,GSE233276,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/29
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with active idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) and healthy controls (HC) [HC_vs_INS],An autoimmune B cell origin for childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is predicted based on the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) at maintaining long-term remission from proteinuria. Knowledge regarding the nature of the culprit B cell response is very limited. In particular__ no transcriptomics work has been performed to evaluate the B cell response in INS. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from four affected children with active INS and four age/sex-matched health controls (HC)__ we demonstrate that a B cell transcriptional program poised for effector functions represents the major immune perturbation in the blood of children with active INS. We show that this nephrotic B cell signature is conferred by the engagement of memory B cells through an extrafollicular developmental route defined by expression of the interfollicular-homing gene GPR183 and the expansion of atypical B cells and marginal zone-like B cells. Moreover__ we show that genes involved in APRIL signaling__ which promotes extrafollicular antibody-secreting cell development__ were substantially upregulated in B cells__ monocytes__ and dendritic cells from INS children. Collectively__ our study provides evidence for an extrafollicular origin for humoral immunity in active INS.,GSE233275,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/29
Early-to-mid stage idiopathic Parkinson’s disease shows enhanced cytotoxicity and differentiation in CD8 T-cells in females,Neuroinflammation in the brain contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD)__ but the potential dysregulation of peripheral immunity has not been systematically investigated for idiopathic PD (iPD). Here we showed an elevated peripheral cytotoxic immune milieu__ with more terminally-differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) CD8 T__ CD8+ NKT cells and circulating cytotoxic molecules in fresh blood of early-to-mid iPD__ especially in females__ after analyzing >700 innate and adaptive features. This profile__ also reflected by fewer CD8+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells__ was confirmed in another subcohort. Co-expression between cytotoxic molecules was selectively enhanced in CD8 TEMRA and effector memory (TEM) cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated the accelerated CD8 differentiation within CD8 compartments__ enhanced cytotoxic pathways in CD8 TEMRA and TEM cells__ while CD8 central-memory (TCM) and naïve cells were already more-active and transcriptionally-reprogrammed. Our work provides a comprehensive map of dysregulated peripheral immunity in iPD__ proposing previously-unrecognized candidates for early diagnosis and treatments.,GSE237254,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/13
Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Conjunction with TLR Agonist Polarizes Interferon Immune Responses Associated with Long-term Survival in Malignant Glioma Patients [scRNA-seq],Autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell (ATL-DC) vaccination is a promising immunotherapy for patients with high grade gliomas__ but responses have not been demonstrated in all patients. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can enhance the anti-tumor immune response from cancer vaccines. To determine the most effective combination of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination__ with or without the adjuvant toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists poly-ICLC or resiquimod__ we conducted a randomized__ open-label multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival in 23 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent WHO Grade III-IV malignant gliomas. Patients were randomized to receive ATL-DC vaccination with either a placebo__ a TLR-7/8 agonist (resiquimod__ topical 0.2%)__ or a TLR-3 agonist (poly-ICLC__ 20 mcg/kg intramuscular). Peripheral blood was obtained at baseline and following the vaccination cycle for immune monitoring. Mass cytometry__ bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses were performed. Analysis of the bulk RNAseq data (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) demonstrated highly significant upregulation of type 1 and type 2 interferon gene expression selectively in patients who received adjuvant TLR agonist (either poly-ICLC or resiquimod) together with ATL-DC. CyTOF analysis of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed increased levels of memory PD-1+ T-cell and monocyte populations after ATL-DC + TLR agonist administration. In addition__ scRNA-seq demonstrated a higher expression fold change of IFN-induced genes with poly-ICLC treatment in both peripheral blood monocytes and T lymphocytes. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.1 months (5.5 placebo vs. 8.1 resiquimod vs. 31.4 poly-ICLC)__ and median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (7.7 placebo vs. 16.7 resiquimod vs. 52.5 poly-ICLC). Patients who had higher expression of interferon response genes lived significantly longer and had longer time to progression compared to those with lower expression. The results suggest that ATL-DC in conjunction with adjuvant poly-ICLCTL induces a polarized interferon response in circulating monocytes and specific activation of a CD8+ T cell population. This combination was associated with extended survival in this patient population. This interferon response signature may represent an important blood biomarker for immunotherapy in patients with malignant glioma.,GSE237579,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/11

Molecular Dissection of Disease Heterogeneity in SLE,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects 1 in 537 of African American (AA) women__ which is >2-fold more than European American (EA) women. AA patients also develop the disease at a younger age__ have more severe symptoms__ and a greater chance of early mortality. We used a multi-omics approach to uncover ancestry-specific immune alterations in SLE patients and healthy controls that may contribute to disease disparities. Cell composition__ signaling__ and epigenetics were evaluated by mass cytometry; droplet-based single cell transcriptomics and paired proteogenomics (scRNA-Seq/scCITE-Seq). Soluble mediator levels were measured in plasma and stimulated whole blood. TLR3/4/7/8/9 gene expression pathways in B cells and monocytes were enhanced in AA SLE patients compared to EA patients. TLR7/8/9 and IFN phospho-signaling responses were also heightened in healthy AA versus EA controls. Exposure of AA and EA healthy control cells to TLR7/8/9 agonists or IFN resulted in altered immune cell compositions that recapitulated the ancestry-associated differences in SLE patients. These data support that ancestry-based differences in TLR7/8__ TLR9__ and IFN responses that can be detected in healthy individuals could influence lupus disease course and severity.,GSE189050,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/11

CITE-seq reveals inhibition of NF-kB pathway in B cells from vitamin D-treated multiple sclerosis patients,Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is correlated with disease activity and progression. Vitamin D treatment has emerged as potentially protective__ even though results from randomized controlled trials are conflicting. Here__ we used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) coupled with barcoded antibodies targeting surface markers (CITE-seq) to discover candidate genes and pathways regulated in PBMC subpopulations from MS patients treated with high-dose vitamin D (n=5) or placebo (n=5). Best candidates were combined with genes involved in immune function and vitamin D metabolism for validation in a new cohort (n=8 in each group) by high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) in naive CD4__ Th1__ Th17__ Treg__ naive CD8__ memory and naive B cells__ and MAIT cells__ sorted by FACS. CITE-seq showed no significant changes in the proportions of these subpopulations in vitamin D-treated patients. Of the 92 candidate genes revealed by CITE-seq__ differential expression of five genes (UXT__ SNRPN__ SUB1__ GNLY and KLF6) was validated by HT-qPCR. CITE-seq also revealed the regulation of several pathways by vitamin D in naive and memory B cells__ including MAPK__ TLR and interleukin pathways__ that contribute to counteract EBV-induced resistance to apoptosis through inhibition of the NF-kB pathway.,GSE239626,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/10/05
Microenvironment-dependent growth of Sezary cells in humanized IL-15 mice [scRNA/TCR-seq],Sezary syndrome (SS) is a rare__ aggressive leukemic variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) that lacks adequate therapeutic options and representative small animal models. Here we demonstrate that IL-15 is a critical CTCL growth and survival factor. Importantly__ a genetically engineered immunodeficient mouse model expressing human IL-15 uniquely supported the growth of patient derived Sezary cells relative to conventional immunodeficient mouse strains. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) SS models recapacitated the pathologic features of the human disease__ including skin infiltration and spread of leukemic cells to the periphery__ and maintained the dependence on human IL-15 upon serial in vivo passaging. Detailed molecular characterization of the engrafted cells by single cell transcriptome analysis revealed tissue specific regulation of gene expression and distinct clonal engraftment patterns. Overall__ we document an important dependence of Sezary cell survival and proliferation on IL-15 signaling and the utility of the humanized IL-15__ immunodeficient mice for SS PDX model generation. Furthermore__ these studies advocate for the thorough molecular understanding of the resultant PDX models to maximize their translational impact.,GSE229406,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/09/29
COSMOS: A Platform for real-time morphology-based__ label-free cell sorting using deep learning (targeted RNA-Seq),Cells are the singular building blocks of life__ and comprehensive understanding of morphology among other properties is crucial to assessment of underlying heterogeneity. We developed Computational Sorting and Mapping of Single Cells (COSMOS)__ a platform based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and microfluidics to characterize and sort single cells based on real-time deep learning interpretation of high-resolution brightfield images. Supervised deep learning models were applied to characterize and sort cell lines and dissociated primary tissue based on high-dimensional embedding vectors of morphology without need for biomarker labels and stains/dyes. We demonstrate COSMOS capabilities with multiple human cell lines and tissue samples. These early results suggest that our neural networks embedding space can capture and recapitulate deep visual characteristics and can be used to efficiently purify unlabeled viable cells with desired morphological traits. Our approach resolves a technical gap in ability to perform real-time deep learning assessment and sorting of cells based on high-resolution brightfield images.,GSE241835,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/09/25

A single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response in patients with influenza A virus infection,Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a critical global health problem__ especially for vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women. While certain circulating cell subsets are thought to differentially modulate the immune response to IAV infection__ the nature and function of these subsets is unclear. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the cellular subtypes and molecular characteristics of PBMCs across different populations with IAV infection. By revealing significant differences in immune responses to IAV among these populations__ our study could aid in the development of immune intervention measures to control IAV and improve patient outcomes.,GSE243629,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/09/21
Single-cell epigenetic__ transcriptional__ and protein states of HIV-1-infected cells [scATAC-seq],The heterogeneity and rarity of HIV-1-infected cells hampers effective cure strategies. We used single-cell DOGMA-seq to simultaneously capture transcription factor accessibility__ transcriptome__ 156 surface proteins__ HIV-1 DNA__ and HIV-1 RNA from six HIV-1+ individuals during viremia and after suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We identified 252 transcriptionally inactive (HIV-1 DNA+ RNA–) and 270 transcriptionally active (HIV-1 RNA+) HIV-1-infected cells from 82__549 memory CD4+ T cells. We identified increased transcription factor accessibility in HIV-1 DNA+ RNA– cells (RORC) and HIV-1 RNA+ cells (IRF and AP-1)__ in addition to CNC and MAF in both. Both HIV-1 DNA+ RNA– and HIV-1 RNA+ cells upregulate IKZF3 (Aiolos) that correlates with proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells. We revealed that the heterogeneous HIV-1-infected T cells comprise four distinct immune programs driven by epigenetic regulators – IRF-activation__ Eomes-cytotoxic effector__ AP-1-migration__ and cell death.

Multiomic Single Cell Evaluation Reveals Inflammatory Cytokines Affect Innate Lymphoid Cell Fate After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation [scATAC-Seq],Type II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) maintain homeostasis and barrier integrity in mucosal tissues. Previous work has shown that in mice and humans__ ILC2s fail to reconstitute after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Determining the mechanisms involved in their impaired reconstitution could improve transplant outcomes. By integrating chromatin and transcriptomic analysis of marked__ transplanted ILC2s at the single cell level__ we identify a previously unreported population of converted ILC1-like cells in the small intestine post-transplant. Exposure of ILC2s to proinflammatory cytokines in vitro results in a mixed ILC1-ILC2 phenotype but was able to convert only an extremely small population of ILC2s to ILC1s as observed in vivo. Whereas ILC2s protected against acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) mediated-morbidity and mortality__ infusion of proinflammatory cytokine-exposed ILC2s accelerated aGvHD. Finally__ circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with aGvHD have an altered ILC2-associated chromatin landscape compared to transplanted controls. These data demonstrate__ for the first time__ that ILC2s fail to repopulate their protective niche after allo-HSCT in part due to conversion to a pro-pathogenic population marked by an ILC1-like chromatin state__ providing novel insights into the contribution of ILC plasticity to aGvHD pathogenesis after allo-HSCT.,GSE232002,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/09/14
Single-cell multi-omics sequencing reveals the functional regulatory landscape of STAT3-V637M Hyper-IgE syndrome,Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by__ among others__ the excessive production of IgE and repetitive bacterial/fungal infections. Although STAT3 is a known causative factor of HIES__ the biological consequences of STAT3 mutation are not completely understood__ especially at the epigenetic level. Here__ we used multi-omic approaches to decipher the multidimensional immune disturbance in a male HIES patient harboring STAT3-V637M. In his peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) we found significant clonal expansion of CD8 T cells (whose expression of CD8 subunits was increased__ resulting in enhanced responsiveness to MHC I molecules)__ but not CD4 T cells and B cells in his. The lack of T cells-B cells interaction could be responsible for the limited number of his B cells__ although they exhibited a higher potential in producing immunoglobulin__ elevated SPIC binding might bias this process toward IgE isotype production. Immune checkpoint inhibitors__ including CTLA4__ LAG3__ were overexpressed in his PBMC-CD4 T cells__ accompanied by reduced CD28 and IL6ST (gp130) expression. For his CD4 T cells__ integrative analyses predicted upstream transcription factors (ETV6__ KLF13__ and RORA) for LAG3__ IL6ST__ and CD28__ respectively. The down-regulated phagocytic__ and nitric oxide synthetic genes in his PBMC-monocytes seem to be the culprit of his disseminated bacterial/fungal infection. In his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)__ we identified two macrophages with anti-bacterial properties__ which were characterized by CXCL8/S100A8/S100A9__ or SOD2__ respectively. Together__ this study comprehensively described how the immune cell landscape was disturbed in STAT3-V637M HIES and provided a resource for further studies on STAT3 biology.,GSE212479,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/09/07
Comprehensive single-cell immune profiling of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes in acral lentiginous melanoma with therapeutic implications.,Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common melanoma subtype in non-Caucasians. Despite significant advances in cancer immunotherapy__ current immune checkpoint inhibitors remain unsatisfactory for ALM. Hence__ we conducted a comprehensive immune profiling using single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis__ along with the reactivity screening of TCRs of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) in ALM. We identified tumor-reactive CD8 T cell populations__ primarily exhibiting an exhausted state__ within multiple phenotypic subsets of TILs in ALM. In comparison to cutaneous melanoma__ clusters with tumor-reactive phenotype presented a lower abundance__ and enrichment of Treg cells were observed__ suggesting suppressive immune microenvironment of ALM. We found a heterogeneous expression of co-inhibitory molecules in tumor-reactive CD8 TILs__ with a subpopulation of activated T cells that was rich in genes related to cytotoxicity and marked by the expression of KLRC1 (NKG2A)__ a suppressive co-inhibitory molecule with therapeutic implications. Overall__ our study provides a foundation for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in ALM.,GSE242477,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/09/06
Single cell transcriptomic atlas of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells reveals a distinct cytotoxic-like subset in HIV-1 infected individuals.,To understand how the transcriptome of pDCs is impacted by HIV-1 infection and exogenous stimulation__ we sorted pDCs from people with HIV-1 (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment before and after toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist treatment__ as well as from healthy controls__ and performed single-cell (sc)-RNA sequencing. We generated a transcriptomic atlas of over 112__000 pDCs. Our cluster analysis revealed an inducible cytotoxic-like pDC cluster characterized by high expression of both antiviral and cytotoxic genes. We further reported that this cytotoxic-like pDC cluster is distinct from NK and T cells. This observation was further supported by our cell-cell communication analysis revealing that cytotoxic-like pDCs exhibit similar incoming and outgoing cellular communicating signals as other pDCs. In addition to the cytotoxic-like pDC cluster__ we also characterized two homogenous pDC clusters (pDC1 and pDC2) and an exhausted pDC cluster. In conclusion__ our findings provide a comprehensive pDC transcriptomic atlas and open a new scope on the mechanisms of regulation and function of cytotoxic-like pDCs in HIV and other infections.,GSE228078,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/09/05
A Hub Gene Signature as a Therapeutic Target and Biomarker for Sepsis and Geriatric Sepsis-Induced ARDS Concomitant with COVID-19 Infection,Background: COVID-19 and sepsis represent formidable public health challenges__ characterized by incompletely elucidated molecular mechanisms. Elucidating the interplay between COVID-19 and sepsis__ particularly in geriatric patients suffering from sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)__ is of paramount importance for identifying potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate hospitalization and mortality risks.We employed bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to identify hub genes__ shared pathways__ molecular biomarkers__ and candidate therapeutics for managing COVID-19__ sepsis__ and sepsis-induced ARDS. We corroborated these hub genes utilizing murine sepsis-ARDS models and blood samples derived from geriatric patients afflicted by sepsis-induced ARDS.Results: Our investigation revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared among COVID-19 and sepsis datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network__ unearthing pivotal hub genes and modules. Notably__ nine hub genes displayed significant alterations and correlations with critical inflammatory mediators of pulmonary injury in murine septic lungs. Simultaneously__ 12 displayed significant changes and correlations with a neutrophil-recruiting chemokine in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. Of these__ six hub genes (CD247__ CD2__ CD40LG__ KLRB1__ LCN2__ RETN) showed significant alterations across COVID-19__ sepsis__ and geriatric sepsis-induced ARDS.

Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals immune cell heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukaemia peripheral blood mononuclear cells after chemotherapy,Purpose Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the rapid clonal expansion of abnormally differentiated myeloid progenitor cells residing in a complex microenvironment. However__ the immune cell types__ status__ and genome profile of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) microenvironment in AML patients after chemotherapy are poorly understood. In order to explore the immune microenvironment of AML patients after chemotherapy__ we conducted this study for providing insights into precision medicine and immunotherapy of AML. Methods In this study__ we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse the PBMC microenvironment from five AML patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens and six healthy donors. We compared the cell compositions in AML patients and healthy donors__ and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)__ CellPhoneDB__ and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. Results Using scRNA-seq technology__ 91__772 high quality cells of 44__950 PBMCs from AML patients and 46__822 PBMCs from healthy donors were classified as 14 major cell clusters. Our study revealed the sub-cluster diversity of T cells__ natural killer (NK) cells__ monocytes__ dendritic cells (DCs)__ and haematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC-Prog) in AML patients under chemotherapy. NK cells and monocyte-DCs showed significant changes in transcription factor expression and chromosome copy number variation (CNV). We also observed significant heterogeneity in CNV and intercellular interaction networks in HSC-Prog cells. Conclusion Our results elucidated the PBMC single-cell landscape and provided insights into precision medicine and immunotherapy for treating AML.,GSE235857,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/31

Tri-modal Single Cell Approach Reveals Cellular and Molecular Heterogeneity in Naïve T cells Across Human Age,The naïve T cell compartment undergoes multiple changes across age that associate with altered susceptibility to infection and autoimmunity. In addition to the acquisition of naïve-like memory T cell subsets__ recent murine studies describe substantial molecular reprogramming of the naïve compartment in adults compared with adolescents. However__ these alterations are not well delineated in human aging. Using a new trimodal single cell technology (TEA-seq)__ we discovered that the composition as well as the transcriptional and epigenetic programming of the naïve T cell compartment in children (11-13 yrs) is distinct from that of older adults (55-65 yrs). Naive CD4 T cells__ previously considered relatively resistant to aging__ exhibited far more pronounced molecular reprogramming than the CD8 compartment__ in which alterations are preferentially driven by shifts in naive-like memory subsets. These data reveal the complex nature of the naïve T cell compartment that may contribute to differential immune responses across the spectrum of human age. ,GSE214546,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/08/31
­­Rapid TCR:Epitope Ranker (RAPTER): A primary human T cell reactivity screening assay pairing epitope and TCR at single cell resolution,Identifying epitopes that T cells respond to is critical to understanding T cell-mediated immunity. Traditional multimer and other single cell assays often require large blood volumes and/or expensive HLA-specific reagents and provide limited phenotypic and functional information. Here__ we present the Rapid TCR:Epitope Ranker (RAPTER) assay__ a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-SEQ) method that uses primary human T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to assess functional T cell reactivity at single cell resolution. Using hash-tag oligonucleotide (HTO) coding and T cell activation-induced markers (AIM)__ RAPTER defines paired epitope specificity and TCR sequence and can include RNA- and protein-level T cell phenotype information. We demonstrate that RAPTER identified specific reactivities to viral and tumor antigens at sensitivities as low as 0.15% of total CD8+ T cells__ and deconvoluted low-frequency circulating HPV16-specific T cell clones from a cervical cancer patient. The specificities of TCRs identified by RAPTER for MART1__ EBV__ and influenza epitopes were functionally confirmed in vitro. In summary__ RAPTER identifies low-frequency T cell reactivities using primary cells from low blood volumes__ and the resulting paired TCR: ligand information can directly enable immunogenic antigen selection for vaccine epitope inclusion__ antigen-specific TCR tracking__ and TCR cloning for further therapeutic development.,GSE231977,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/08/25

High-throughput Single-cell Profiling of B cell Responses Following Inactivated Influenza Vaccination in Young and Older Adults (single-cell BCR),Seasonal influenza contributes to a substantial disease burden annually__ resulting in approximately 10 million hospital visits and 50 thousand deaths in a typical year in the US. 90% of the annual mortality from influenza occurs in people over the age of 65. While influenza vaccination is the best protection against the virus__ it is less effective for the elderly. This may be due to differences in the quantity or type of B cells induced by vaccination in older individuals. To investigate this possibility__ we leveraged recent development in single-cell technology that allows for simultaneous measurement of both gene expression profile and the B cell receptor (BCR) at single-cell resolution. Pre- and post-vaccination peripheral blood B cells were sorted from three young and three older adults who responded to the inactivated influenza vaccine and were profiled using single-cell RNAseq with paired BCR sequencing. At pre-vaccination__ we observed a higher somatic hypermutation frequency and a higher abundance of activated B cells in older adults than in young adults. Following vaccination__ young adults mounted a more clonal response than older adults. The response involved a mix of plasmablasts__ activated B cells__ and resting memory B cells in both age groups. The response in young adults was dominated by expansion in plasmablasts__ while the response in older adults also involved activated B cells. We observed a consistent change in gene expression in plasmablasts after vaccination between age groups but not in the activated B cells. These quantitative and qualitative differences in the B cell response may provide insights into the age-related change of influenza vaccination response.,GSE175523,Homo sapiens,Other,2023/08/20

Effects of methanol fixation and rehydration on single cell transcriptome of acute myeloid leukemia.,The application of single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly enhanced our comprehension of diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in physiological and pathophysiological processes. However__ obtaining living cells for this technique can be challenging under certain conditions. To address this__ the methanol cell fixation method has emerged as a promising alternative__ demonstrating intriguing outcomes for routine utilization while inducing fewer modifications in the cell transcriptome compared to conventional cryopreservation methods.,GSE237239,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/17
Long-term effects of Omicron BA.2 breakthrough infection on immunity-metabolism balance: a 6-month prospective study,There have been reports of long coronavirus disease (long COVID) and breakthrough infections (BTIs); however__ the mechanisms and pathological features of long COVID after Omicron BTIs remain unclear. Assessing long COVID and immune recovery after Omicron BTIs is crucial for understanding the disease and developing and managing new-generation vaccines. Here__ we followed up mild BA.2 BTI convalescents for six-month with routine blood tests and neutralization assay. Then__ we applied proteomic analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the convalescents’ recovery status. Lastly__ we retrospectively analyzed the clinical parameters related to immunity and metabolism of the convalescents. We found that major organs exhibited ephemeral dysfunction in double-Convidecia vaccinated persons who experienced BA.2 BTI and recovered to normal in approximately six-month. We observed durable and potent levels of neutralizing antibodies against major circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sub-variants__ including BQ.1__ BQ.1.1 and BF.7__ indicating that hybrid humoral immunity stays active. However__ PLTs may take longer to recover. This was supported by proteomic and scRNA-seq analyses__ which also showed coagulation disorder and an imbalance between anti-pathogen immunity and metabolism six-month after BA.2 BTI. The immunity-metabolism imbalance was then proved with retrospective analysis of abnormal levels of hormones__ low blood glucose level and coagulation profile. The long-term malfunctional coagulation and imbalance in the material metabolism and immunity may contribute to the development of long COVID and act as useful indicators for assessing recovery and the long-term impacts after Omicron sub-variant BTIs.,GSE240694,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/16
Single-cell multi-omics defines the cell-type specific impact of splicing aberrations in human hematopoietic clonal outgrowths,RNA splicing factors are recurrently affected by alteration-of-function mutations in clonal blood disorders__ highlighting the importance of splicing regulation in hematopoiesis. However__ our understanding of the impact of dysregulated RNA splicing has been hampered by the inability to distinguish mutant and wildtype cells in primary patient samples__ the cell-type complexity of the hematopoietic system__ and the sparse coverage of splice junctions by short-read sequencing typically used in single-cell RNA sequencing. To overcome these limitations__ we developed GoT-Splice by integrating Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) with enhanced efficiency long-read single-cell transcriptome profiling__ as well as proteogenomics (with CITE-seq). This allowed for the simultaneous single-cell profiling of gene expression__ cell surface protein markers__ somatic mutation status__ and RNA splicing. We applied GoT-Splice to bone marrow progenitors from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) affected by mutations in the most prevalent mutated RNA splicing factor – the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1. High-resolution mapping of SF3B1mut vs. SF3B1wt hematopoietic progenitors revealed increased fitness advantage of SF3B1mut cells in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage__ resulting in an expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor (EP) cells. SF3B1mut EP cells exhibited upregulation of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and mRNA translation. Long-read single-cell transcriptomes revealed the previously reported increase of aberrant 3’ splicing site usage in SF3B1mut cells. However__ the ability to profile splicing within individual cell populations uncovered distinct cryptic 3’ splice site usage across different progenitor populations__ as well as stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid maturation. Lastly__ as splice factor mutations occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with increased risk of neoplastic transformation__ we applied GoT-Splice to CH samples. These data revealed that the erythroid lineage bias__ as well as cell-type specific cryptic 3’ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells__ precede overt MDS. Collectively__ we present an expanded multi-omics single-cell toolkit to define the cell-type specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing__ from the earliest phases of clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia__ directly in human samples.,GSE204845,Homo sapiens,Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/14
Identification of cow milk epitopes to characterize and quantify disease-specific T cells in allergic children,Cow milk (CM) allergy is the most prevalent food allergy in young children in the US and Great Britain. Current diagnostic tests are either unreliable (IgE__ skin prick test)__ or resource-intensive with risks (food challenges). Here we set out to determine if allergen-specific T cells in cow milk allergic (CMA) patients have a distinct quality and/or quantity that could potentially be used as a diagnostic marker. Starting from cow milk extract__ we mapped T cell responses to a set of reactive epitopes that we compiled in a peptide pool. This pool induced cytokine responses in in vitro cultured cells distinguishing allergic from non-allergic subjects. Using single-cell RNA and paired TCR sequencing we detected significant changes in the transcriptional program and clonality of cow milk antigen-specific (CM+) T cells elicited by the pool in allergic vs. non-allergic subjects ex vivo. CM+ T cells from allergic subjects had increased percentages of FOXP3+ over FOXP3- cells. FOXP3+ cells are often equated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have suppressive activity__ but CM+ FOXP3+ cells from allergic subjects showed significant expression of interferon-responsive genes and dysregulated chemokine receptor expression compared to non-allergic subjects__ suggesting that these are not conventional Tregs. The CM+ FOXP3+ cells were also more clonally expanded than the FOXP3- population. We were further able to utilize surface markers (CD25__ CD127__ CCR7) in combination with our peptide pool stimulation to quantify these CM+ FOXP3+ cells by a simple flow cytometry assay. We show increased percentages of CM+ CD127-CD25+ cells from CMA subjects in an independent cohort__ which could be used for diagnostic purposes. Looking specifically for Th2 cells normally associated with allergic diseases__ we found a small population of clonally expanded CM+ cells that were significantly increased in CMA subjects and that had high expression of Th2 cytokines and pathogenic Th2/Tfh markers. Overall__ these findings suggest that there are several differences in the phenotype of CM+ T cells with CM allergy and that the increase in CM+ FOXP3+ cells is a potential diagnostic marker of an allergic state. Such markers have promising applications in monitoring natural disease outgrowth and/or the efficacy of immunotherapy that will need to be validated in future studies.,GSE231590,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/10
Single cell RNA sequencing of sorted NK__ CD8+ T__ γδ T__ and KIR3DL3+ cells from PBMC,NK cells stochastically express a range of inhibitory and activating receptors that balance their effector functions. Of these receptors__ the KIRs are the most polymorphic__ with KIR3DL3 present at two copies in every individual. The distribution and biology KIR3DL3 remain understudied. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptome of KIR3DL3+ lymphocytes in the blood.,GSE232917,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/08
Latent human herpesvirus 6 is reactivated in chimeric antigen receptor T cells,Cell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects of treatment__ including neurotoxicity. Currently__ we lack a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity observed in patients receiving cell therapies__ including encephalitis caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) that has been repeatedly reported. Here__ via comprehensive viral RNA data mining__ we examine the landscape of human latent viral reactivation__ revealing that HHV-6B can become reactivated in human CD4+ T cells in standard in vitro cultures. Using single-cell sequencing__ we identify a rare population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10__000 cells) that possess high viral transcriptional activity in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture before spreading rapidly to infect other cells in vitro. Through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products__ we identify the presence of CAR+__ HHV-6 super-expressor T cells in human patients in vivo. Together__ our study implicates cell therapy products as the source of lytic HHV-6 repeatedly reported in clinical trialsand has broad implications for the design__ screening__ and interpretation of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies.,GSE210063,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/05
Integrated BATF transcriptional network regulates suppressive intratumoral regulatory T cells,Human regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial regulators of tissue repair__ autoimmune diseases__ and cancer. However__ it is challenging to inhibit the suppressive function of Tregs for cancer therapy__ without impacting immune homeostasis. Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important__ yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression__ and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues__ remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)__ in non-tumor tonsil tissues and in peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with non-tumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically__ the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing__ immunophenotyping and in vitro functional assays__ corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs. Finally__ we identified a suite of surface molecules reflective of the BATF-driven transcriptional network on intratumoral Tregs in patients with HNSCC. These findings uncover a primary transcriptional regulator of highly suppressive intratumoral Tregs__ highlighting potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer without impacting immune homeostasis.,GSE239750,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/03
Single-cell RNAseq uncovers cellular heterogeneity and provides a signature for pediatric sleep apnea ,Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease and a major cause of systemic inflammation leading to neurocognitive__ behavioral__ metabolic__ and cardiovascular dysfunction in children and adults.

Tumor-associated monocytes promote mesenchymal transformation through EGFR signaling in glioma,The role of brain immune compartments in glioma evolution remains elusive. We profiled immune cells in glioma microenvironment and the matched peripheral blood from 11 patients at a single-cell level. Notably__ glioblastoma exhibits specific infiltration of certain blood-originated monocytes expressing EGFR ligands including EREG and AREG__ coined as tumor-associated monocytes (TAMo). TAMo infiltration is mutually exclusive with EGFR alterations (P = 0.019)__ while co-occurring with mesenchymal subtype (P = 4.7x10-7) and marking worse prognosis (P = 0.004 and 0.032 in two independent cohorts). Evolutionary analysis of initial-recurrent glioma pairs and single-cell study of a multi-centric glioblastoma reveals remarkable association between elevated TAMo and glioma mesenchymal transformation. Further analysis identifies FOSL2 as a master regulator of TAMo. The roles of FOSL2-EREG/AREG-EGFR signaling axis in promoting glioma invasion were verified experimentally. Collectively__ we have identified TAMo in tumor microenvironment and revealed its driving role in activating EGFR signaling to shape glioma evolution.,GSE237779,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/08/01
Tumor-reactive clonotype dynamics dictate clinical response to TIL therapy in melanoma [TCR-Seq],Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is effective in cancer patients__ yet the profiles__ specificity and dynamics of tumor clonotypes remain opaque. Using single-cell RNA/TCR-sequencing__ clonotypes were tracked from baseline tumors to ACT products (ACTP) and post-ACT blood and tumor samples from 13 metastatic melanoma patients (NCT03475134). Furthermore__ a predictor of tumor-reactive clonotypes was derived from the transcriptomic profiles of tumor-specific or bystander clones. Patients with clinical responses had tumors enriched in tumor-reactive TILs__ preferentially expanding in-vitro to generate larger and more tumoricidal products and preferentially re-infiltrating tumors post-ACT. Conversely__ lack of responses was associated with tumors devoid of tumor-reactive clonotypes and with cell products mostly composed of blood-borne clonotypes. The exhaustion state characterizing intratumoral tumor-reactive TILs was attenuated during in-vitro expansion and restored after tumor re-engraftment only in responders. Thus__ tumor-reactive clonotypes drive clinical response to TIL therapy__ providing insight to select patients or improve TILs’ culture.,GSE234352,Homo sapiens,Other,2023/08/01
Single Cell Analysis Identifies Conserved Features of Immune Dysfunction in Simulated Microgravity and Spaceflight [scRNA-Seq],Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction__ though the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here__ using single cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity__ we characterize altered genes and pathways across immune cells under basal and stimulated states with a Toll like Receptor-7/8 agonist. At basal state__ simulated microgravity altered the transcriptional landscape across immune cells__ with monocyte subsets showing most pathway changes. Remarkably__ short term simulated microgravity was sufficient to increase endogenous retroviral and mycobacterial transcripts.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the transcriptomic characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hepatitis B vaccine non-responders,The emergence of a vaccine against hepatitis B has proven to be an important milestone in the prevention of this disease; however__ 5%–10% of vaccinated individuals do not generate an immune response to the vaccine__ and its molecular mechanism has not been clarified. In this study__ single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three volunteers with a high immune response (HR) and three with no immune response (NR) to the hepatitis B vaccine. We found that the antigenpresenting activity scores of various antigen-presenting cells__ the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity scores of naive B cells__ and the cell activity scores of three types of effector T cells were significantly decreased__ whereas the cytotoxicity scores of CD3highCD16lowKLRG1high natural killer T (NKT) cells were significantly increased in the NR group compared with those in the HR group. Additionally__ the expression levels of some classical molecules associated with distinct signaling pathways—including HLA-B__ HLA-DRB5__ BLNK__ BLK__ IL4R__ SCIMP__ JUN__ CEBPB__ NDFIP1__ and TXNIP— were significantly reduced in corresponding subsets of PBMCs from the NR group relative to those of the HR group. Furthermore__ the expression of several cytotoxicity-related effector molecules__ such as GNLY__ NKG7__ GZMB__ GZMM__ KLRC1__ KLRD1__ PRF1__ CST7__ and CTSW__ was significantly higher in CD3highCD16lowKLRG1high NKT cells derived from non-responders. Our study provides a molecular basis for the lack of response to the hepatitis B vaccine__ including defective antigen presentation__ decreased T cell activity__ and reduced IL-4 secretion__ as well as novel insight into the role of NKT cells in the immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine.,GSE229431,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/30
Metabolic Programs of T Cell Tissue Residency Empower Tumor Immunity [Human scRNA-seq],Tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) offer fast__ robust__ and long-term protection at sites of re-infection1. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with characteristics of TRM maintain enhanced effector functions__ predict responses to immunotherapy__ and accompany better prognoses2__3. Thus__ an improved understanding of the metabolic strategies that enable tissue residency could inform new approaches to empower T cell responses in tissues and solid tumors. To systematically define the basis for the metabolic reprogramming supporting TRM differentiation__ survival__ and function__ we leveraged in vivo functional genomics__ untargeted metabolomics__ and transcriptomics of virus-specific memory CD8 T cell populations. We found that memory CD8 T cells deployed a range of adaptations to tissue residency__ including a marked reliance on non-steroidal products of the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway__ such as Coenzyme Q (CoQ)__ driven by increased activity of the transcription factor Srebp2. This metabolic adaptation was most pronounced in the small intestine (SI)__ where TRM interface with dietary cholesterol and maintain a heightened state of activation4__ and was shared by functional TIL in diverse tumor types in mice and humans. Enforcing CoQ synthesis through Fdft1 deletion or Pdss2 overexpression promoted mitochondrial respiration__ memory formation upon viral infection__ and enhanced antitumor immunity. In sum__ through a systematic exploration of TRM metabolism__ we reveal how these programs can be leveraged to empower CD8 T cell memory formation in the context of acute infections and enhance antitumor immunity.,GSE239293,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/28
Identification of human exTregs as CD16+CD56+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells.,In chronic inflammatory diseases with an autoimmune component like atherosclerosis__ some regulatory T cells (Tregs) lose their regulatory function and become exTregs. The present study was designed to identify surface markers specific of human exTregs__ using an integrated approach from sorted mouse exTregs bulk RNA-Seq to human scRNA-Seq with CITE-Seq__ to sort human exTregs and characterize them by transcriptome and function. We crossed inducible Treg lineage tracker mice (FoxP3-eGFP-Cre-ERT2 ROSA26CAG-fl-stop-fl-tdTomato) to atherosclerosis-prone Apoe -/- mice__ sorted Tregs and exTregs from lymph nodes and spleens of replicate mice and determined their transcriptomes by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A support vector machine (SVM) approach identified the leading signature genes for exTregs as CST7__ NKG7__ GZMA__ PRF1__ TBX21 and CCL4. Projecting these genes onto feature maps of human PBMC single cell (sc)RNA-Seq with CITE-Seq from 61 subjects with and without atherosclerosis showed that CST7__ NKG7__ GZMA__ PRF1__ TBX21 and CCL4 mapped to CD4 T cells that expressed CD56 and CD16. This finding was validated in a second__ independent scRNA- and CITE-Seq dataset. Even in healthy volunteers__ a subpopulation of CD4 T cells expressed both CD56 and CD16. Bulk RNA-Seq identified these cells as cytotoxic CD4 T cells__ which was functionally confirmed in a cell killing assay. DNA sequencing for TCRβ showed clonal expansion of Treg CDR3 sequences in CD16 + CD56 + exTregs. Taken together__ we identify mouse and human exTregs as cytotoxic CD4 T cells.,GSE217010,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/25
Scalable single-cell profiling of chromatin modifications with sciCUT&Tag,Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) is an antibody-directed in situ chromatin profiling strategy that is rapidly replacing precipitation-based methods. The efficiency of the method enabled chromatin profiling in single cells but is limited by the numbers of cells that can be profiled. Here__ we describe a combinatorial barcoding strategy for CUT&Tag that harnesses a nanowell dispenser for simple__ high-resolution high-throughput single-cell chromatin profiling. We describe a pipeline for single-cell indexed CUT&Tag (sciCUT&Tag) that uses SNPs to facilitate doublet-cell removal and minimize batch effects. We illustrate the optimized protocol by analysis of mouse and human cell lines__ as well as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of patients with autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of CNS,Inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS (IDD) is a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases__ and multiple sclerosis is the most common type. Dendritic cells (DCs)__ major antigen-presenting cells__ have been proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IDD. The AXL+SIGLEC6+ DC (ASDC) has been only recently identified in humans and has a high capability of T cell activation. Nevertheless__ its contribution to CNS autoimmunity remains still obscure. Here__ we aimed to identify the ASDC in diverse sample types from IDD patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A detailed analysis of DC subpopulations using single-cell transcriptomics for the paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of IDD patients (total n = 9) revealed that three subtypes of DCs (ASDCs__ ACY3+ DCs__ and LAMP3+ DCs) were overrepresented in CSF compared with their paired blood. Among these DCs__ ASDCs were also more abundant in CSF of IDD patients than in controls__ manifesting poly-adhesional and stimulatory characteristics. In the brain biopsied tissues of IDD patients__ obtained at the acute attack of disease__ ASDC were also frequently found in close contact with T cells. Lastly__ the frequency of ASDC was found to be temporally more abundant in acute attack of disease both in CSF samples of IDD patients and in tissues of EAE__ an animal model for CNS autoimmunity. Our analysis suggests that the ASDC might be involved in the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity.,GSE194078,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/10
Tracking B Cell Responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccine,The COVID-19 pandemic left an unprecedented social and economic impact on the world. This rapidly evolving global instigated a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine. Despite the generation of a protective antibody response in most individuals after two doses of an anti-spike mRNA vaccine__ some studies have shown that a poorer response is elicited in some individuals__ particularly those that are immunocompromised or elderly. To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms driving B cell evolution in response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2__ we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic__ epitope sequencing (CITE-seq)__ and repertoire profiling of three COVID-19 vaccinees. Spike-specific (S-2P+) B cells showed early immune activation at v1D14 (14 days after vaccine dose 1) and accumulation of somatic hyper mutation (SHM) up to v2M6 (months 6). At v2D6__ the S-2P+ cells expanded into memory B cell (MBC) cluster 5 with a dynamic kinetics over time. At v2M6__ majority of S-2P+ cells were into resting memory (RM) subset within cluster 5. Analysis of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire showed selection of genes commonly detected in neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Tracking of S-2P+ B cell response showed clonal association between earlier activated CD38+ memory__ as well as tissue-like memory__ with RM B cells at v2M6. These clones showed evolving signal with progressive accumulation of SHM over time. The presence of early plasmablast (PB) within these clones corroborates our previous report that associates PB response with sustained immunity. This integrated analysis allowed us to characterize the transcriptional activity underpinning the development of B cells involved in inducing an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine.,GSE219098,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/07
Single cell RNAseq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with mitochondrial disease,Mitochondria are nearly ubiquitous in all cells__ suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may extend to the immune system. In this study__ we utilized Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize cellular heterogeneity and the pathologic underpinnings of mitochondrial disease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pediatric patients. Transcriptomes of individual cells from affected and healthy tissue samples revealed marked reductions in select populations involved in the humoral immune response__ especially antigen presenting cells__ B cell and plasma populations__ with sparing of T cell populations. MTRNR2L8__ a marker of bioenergetic stress__ was significantly elevated in populations that were most depleted. mir4485__ a miRNA contained in the intron of MTRNR2L8__ was co-expressed. mir4485 was found to have a role in promoting survival by modulating apoptosis. The results highlight distinct molecular phenotypes and identify previously unrecognized in mitochondrial diseases.,GSE234505,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/06
spinDrop: a modular droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell RNA sequencing information content,Droplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell RNA sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is__ however__ accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples as well as lower overall RNA capture efficiency. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material at the moment of cell encapsulation and the lack of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase RNA capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks by deploying fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells__ intact nuclei or fixed cells and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold__ while reducing background noise by up to half__ depending on sample quality. We harness these unique properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development using highly damaged input material. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost.,GSE208156,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/07/02

IL-11 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation,The objective of this study is to examine IL-11-induced mechanisms of inflammatory cell migration to the CNS. We report that IL-11 is produced at highest frequency by myeloid cells among the PBMC cell subsets. Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) have an increased frequency of IL-11+ monocytes__ IL-11+ and IL-11R+ CD4+ lymphocytes and IL-11R+ neutrophils in comparison to matched healthy controls (HCs). IL-11+ and GM-CSF+ monocytes__ CD4+ lymphocytes__ and neutrophils accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The effect of IL-11 in-vitro stimulation__ examined using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)__ revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in classical monocytes__ including upregulated NFKB1__ NLRP3 and IL1B. All CD4+ cell subsets had increased expression of S100A8/9 alarmin genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In IL-11R+-sorted cells from the CSF__ classical and intermediate monocytes significantly upregulated the expression of multiple NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes__ including complement__ IL18__ and migratory genes (VEGFA/B) in comparison to blood-derived cells. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway with aIL-11 mAb in mice with RR experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) decreased clinical scores__ CNS inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination. aIL-11 mAb treatment decreased the numbers of NFkBp65+__ NLRP3+ and IL-1b+ monocytes in the CNS of mice with EAE. The results suggest that IL-11/IL-11R signaling in monocytes represents a therapeutic target in RRMS.,GSE233917,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/06/21
An unclassified T cell lymphoma subtype with co-expression of TCR αβ and γ chains revealed by single cell sequencing,T cell lymphomas (TCL) contains a group of heterogeneous non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) with T cell origins. Therapy responses and outcomes remain poor for patients with TCL due to the absence of TCL-specific regimens 1__2. In addition__ TCL is highly heterogenous and contains over 40 subtypes according to 2022 WHO classification 3__ making the diagnosis and treatment more challenging. In this study__ by using single cell technology__ we reported a patient with a previously unreported TCL subtype__ which was featured by a unique TCR presentations (co-expressing of two a chains__ one b chain and one g chain). We deeply dissected the molecular signatures of this unique TCL subtype to better understand the disease biology and molecular pathogenesis__ which can also accelerate the development of novel diagnosis and treatment strategies.,GSE222200,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/06/21

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals peripheral blood mononuclear immune cell landscape associated with operational tolerance in a kidney transplant recipient [2],Operational tolerance (OT) after kidney transplantation is defined as stable graft acceptance without the need for immunosuppression therapy. However__ it is not clear which cellular and molecular pathways are driving tolerance in these patients. In this first-of-its-kind pilot study__ we assessed the immune landscape associated with OT (Tol) using the single-cell analyses. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a kidney transplant recipient (KTR) with OT__ a healthy individual (HC)__ and a KTR with normal kidney function standard of care immunosuppression (SOC) were evaluated. B cell proportion was greatest in Tol with the predominance of TCL1A+ naïve B cells; regulatory T cell (Tregs) was also high in Tol with a relatively higher expression of LSGAL1. Putative ligand-receptor-based cell-cell interactions between B cells and Tregs were identified. TGFB-TGFBR interaction__ present in both Tol and SOC__ leads to the proliferation of Tregs. However__ SOC had the lowest proportion of B cells and Tregs with a G1 phase accumulation of B and T cells. Our findings instigate application of this technology on a larger cohort to identify mediators of tolerance.,GSE230650,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/06/20

scRNA-seq characterization of immune cell types among individuals with or without Long COVID,Long COVID (LC)__ a type of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)__ occurs after at least 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infections__ yet its etiology remains poorly understood. Here__ we used multiple “omics” assays (CyTOF__ RNAseq/scRNAseq__ Olink) and serology to deeply characterize both global and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity from blood of individuals with clear LC and non-LC clinical trajectories__ 8 months following infection and prior to receipt of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells__ which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses__ as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues__ and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies__ and in contrast to non-LC individuals__ exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. RNAseq and Olink analyses similarly revealed immune dysregulatory mechanisms__ along with non-immune associated perturbations__ in individuals with LC. Collectively__ our data suggest that proper crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity has broken down in LC__ and that this__ perhaps in the context of persistent virus__ leads to the immune dysregulation__ inflammation__ and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition.,GSE235050,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/06/19

Gene-regulatory network study of rheumatoid arthritis in single-cell chromatin landscapes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells,Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease with an elusive etiology. Assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with single-cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) contribute to the progress in epigenetic studies. However__ the impact of epigenetic technology on autoimmune diseases has not been objectively analyzed. Therefore__ scATAC-seq was performed to generate a high-resolution map of accessible loci in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients at the single-cell level. The purpose of our project was to discover the transcription factors (TFs) that were involved in the pathogenesis of RA at single-cell resolution. In our research__ we obtained 22 accessible chromatin patterns. Then__ 10 key TFs were involved in the RA pathogenesis by regulating the activity of MAP kinase. Consequently__ two genes (PTPRC__ SPAG9) regulated by 10 key TFs were found that may be associated with RA disease pathogenesis and these TFs were obviously enriched in RA patients (p<0.05__ FC>1.2). With further qPCR validation on PTPRC and SPAG9 in monocytes__ we found differential expression of these two genes__ which were regulated by eight TFs (ZNF384__ HNF1B__ DMRTA2__ MEF2A__ NFE2L1__ CREB3L4 (var. 2)__ FOSL2::JUNB (var. 2)__ MEF2B). What is more__ the eight TFs showed highly accessible binding sites in RA patients. These findings demonstrate the value of using scATAC-seq to reveal transcriptional regulatory variation in RA-derived PBMCs__ providing insights on therapy from an epigenetic perspective.,GSE183970,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/06/13
Evolution of immune and stromal cell states and ecotypes during gastric adenocarcinoma progression,Understanding how the tumor microenvironment (TME) is orchestrated along the continuum of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) may uncover novel therapeutic strategies. Here__ we performed comprehensive single-cell profiling of precancerous lesions__ localized and metastatic GACs__ identifying alterations in TME cell states and phenotypes during tumorigenesis and progression. IgA+ plasma cells appear to be the most active regulators in the premalignant microenvironment__ whereas immunosuppressive myeloid and stromal subsets dominated the late-stage GACs. We discover six TME ecotypes__ four of which are unique to the premalignant/progression in the continuum__ with two ecotypes__ identified in primary GACs__ showing strong associations with histopathologic__ genomic characteristics and prognosis. Extensive stromal remodeling is evident with GAC progression. High SDC2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) correlates with aggressive phenotypes and poor survival and SDC2 overexpression in CAFs contributes to tumor growth. This study illustrates a roadmap of the GAC TME and highlights potential targets for further investigation.,GSE234129,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/06/10

Single-cell transcriptomics reveal hyperacute cytokine and immune checkpoint axis in patients with poor neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest [BRI],Neurological injury is a major driver for mortality among patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest (CA). The early systemic inflammatory response after CA is associated with neurological injury and mortality but remains poorly defined. We determine the innate immune network induced by clinical CA at single-cell resolution. Immune cell states diverge as early as 6h post-arrest between patients with good or poor neurological outcomes at hospital discharge. Nectin-2+ monocytes and Tim-3+ natural killer (NK) cell subpopulations associate with poor outcomes__ and interactome analysis highlight their cross-talk via cytokines and immune checkpoints. Ex vivo studies on peripheral blood cells from CA patients demonstrate that immune checkpoints are a compensatory mechanism for the resolution of inflammation after CA.

Genetic deletion of Cxcr2 in the hMPLW515L adoptive transfer model abrogates fibrosis and extends overall survival__ and pharmacologic inhibition of the CXCR1/2 pathway improves hematologic parameters__ attenuates bone marrow fibrosis__ and synergizes with JAK inhibitor therapy. Our mechanistic insights provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of the CXCL8/CXCR2 pathway in MF patients at risk for continued fibrotic progression.,GSE189978,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/05/12

Proteogenomic and V(D)J Analysis of Human Decidual T cells Highlights Unique Transcriptional Programming and Clonal Distribution [VDJ-seq],Immunological tolerance towards the semi-allogeneic fetus is one of many maternal adaptations required for a successful pregnancy. T cells are major players of the adaptive immune system and balance tolerance and protection at the maternal-fetal interface__ however__ their repertoire and subset programming is still poorly understood. Utilizing emerging scRNA-seq technologies we simultaneously obtained transcript__ limited protein__ and receptor repertoire at the single-cell level__ from decidual and matched maternal peripheral T cells. In agreement with previous work__ we find that the decidua maintains a tissue-specific distribution of T cells compared to the periphery. We find that decidual T cells maintain a unique transcriptome programming__ characterized by restraint of inflammatory pathways by overexpression of negative regulators. Furthermore__ we show little clonal overlap between the decidua and periphery__ suggesting minimal ongoing traffic between these scites. Overall__ our data demonstrate the power of multi-omic analysis in revealing regulation of fetal-maternal immune co-existence.,GSE192558,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/04/26

The utility of circulating CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,Lack of reliable predictive biomarkers is a major limitation of combination therapy with chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy (chemo-immunotherapy). The increase of peripheral blood (PB) CD8+ T cells expressing CX3CR1__ a marker of differentiation__ correlates with response to anti-PD-1 therapy; however__ the predictive and prognostic value of T-cell CX3CR1 expression during chemo-immunotherapy remains elusive. Here__ we evaluated the utility of PB CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. At least 10% increase of the CX3CR1+ subset in circulating CD8+ T cells from baseline (CX3CR1 score) was associated with response to chemo-immunotherapy at 6 weeks (p = 0.0382) and 9 weeks (p = 0.0045). Sensitivity__ specificity__ positive and negative predictive value of at least 10% increase of the CX3CR1 score was 83.3%__ 88.2%__ 83.3% and 88.2%__ respectively with 86.2% overall accuracy of predicting response at 9 weeks. Furthermore__ at least 10% increase of the CX3CR1 score correlated with improved overall (p = 0.0105) and progression-free survival (p = 0.0265). Combined T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of tumor tissue and single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of longitudinal PB samples from a patient who received a long-term benefit from chemo-immunotherapy demonstrated that circulating clonally expanded CD8+ T cells were terminal effector T cells expressing high levels of CX3CR1__ and contained frequent tumor-infiltrating T-cell colonotypes early-on post treatment. Collectively__ these findings suggest the potential utility of T-cell CX3CR1 expression as a dynamic blood-based biomarker during the course of chemo-immunotherapy and a marker to identify frequent tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte repertoires.,GSE213902,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/04/05
STING agonism leads to durable clinical response in an anti-PD-L1 refractory patient: Tumor antigen-specific__ single cell level biomarker analyses.,Background: PD-1 pathway blockade has revolutionized cancer care__ but many patients do not durably benefit from these therapies. Novel treatments to engage anti-tumor immunity in this setting are needed. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein__ an innate sensor of cytoplasmic DNA__ is a promising target with several agonists in development; however__ recent clinical trials of these agents have not demonstrated efficacy for most patients. Here__ we present detailed biomarker analyses of a patient with anti-PD-L1 refractory Merkel cell carcinoma that had a durable (~1 year)__ abscopal response to ADU-S100 (intralesional STING agonist) combined with anti-PD-1 blockade. Methods: Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood acquired pre- and post-treatment were analyzed with single cell RNA sequencing__ 27-color flow cytometry__ T cell receptor sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC; post treatment tumor specimen only). Critically__ cancer-specific CD8 T cells were identified using MHC-I tetramers containing peptides from the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)__ the etiologic agent of this cancer. Cell lines and tumor specimens from 76 patients were used to evaluate STING expression and signaling in MCC. Results: High levels of antigen cancer-specific T cells were observed in the tumor prior to ADU-S100 treatment (12% of T cells recognized an MCPyV epitope). These cancer-specific CD8 T cells exhibited characteristics of exhaustion including high TOX and low TCF1. Following STING agonist treatment__ MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells expanded 3-fold with minimal phenotypic changes. An increase in antigen presentation on MCC tumor cells was also observed (1.8% of tumor cells MHC-I positive before treatment__ 8.2% after treatment). This was not a result of ADU-S100 acting directly on tumor cells as mIHC analysis of 88 tumor samples confirmed little or no STING expression in tumor cells__ but high STING expression on infiltrating immune and stromal cells. Further in vitro studies showed MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines are STING deficient__ and ADU-S100 did not induce interferon. Conclusions: Our study suggests that STING agonists act on intratumoral immune cells to release interferons__ which upregulate tumor cell antigen presentation and reinvigorate the anti-tumor response from pre-existing cancer-specific T cells. Thus__ patients with anti-PD-(L)1-refractory disease showing downregulation of antigen-presentation may benefit from intralesional STING agonists.,GSE227709,Homo sapiens,Other,2023/04/01
Cancer-specific CD8 T cell frequency at baseline in blood correlates with response to PD-1 blockade in Merkel cell carcinoma.,Understanding immunotherapy resistance is challenging due to difficulty identifying cancer-specific T cells. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is typically driven by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)__ facilitating identification of cancer-specific T cells across patients. We characterized cancer-specific T cells in 35 MCC patients__ including participants in a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 trial. Higher MCPyV-specific CD8 T-cell frequency in pre-treatment blood (but not tumors) correlated with response (p=0.005). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells in blood had increased stem/memory signatures and decreased exhaustion signatures relative to their intratumoral counterparts. While frequency of peripheral cancer-specific T cells was associated with response to initial PD-(L)1 blockade__ longitudinal study of acquired resistance revealed immune evasion by tumor-cell MHC-I downregulation despite cancer-specific T cell expansion to 0.5% in blood. Blood thus appears to be an important reservoir of cancer-specific CD8 T cells and adoptive cell therapies may be particularly effective in patients without such cells.,GSE227708,Homo sapiens,Other,2023/04/01
Human OTULIN haploinsufficiency impairs cell-intrinsic immunity to staphylococcal α-toxin,We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls and OTULIN haploinsufficient patients in order to clarify the perturbation__ if any__ of cellular phenotypes in various leukocyte subsets in vivo at basal state attributable to OTULIN haploinsufficiency.,GSE199445,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/04/01
Oral CBD treatment is associated to an anti-inflammatory gene expression signature in myeloid cells of people living with HIV,HIV-related comorbidities appear to be related to chronic inflammation__ a condition characterizing people living with HIV (PLWH). Prior work indicates that cannabidiol (CBD) might reduce inflammation; however__ the genetics underpinning this effect are not well investigated. Our main objective is to detect gene expression alterations in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PLWH after at least one month of CBD treatment. We collected PBMCs from three HIV-positive subjects at baseline and after CBD treatment (at least 27 days) via single-cell RNA sequencing. We obtained a coherent signature__ characterized by an anti-inflammatory activity__ of differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells. Our study shows how CBD is associated with alterations of gene expression in myeloid cells after CBD treatment.,GSE228652,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/31

Allogenic and Autologous anti-CD7 CAR-T cell Therapies in Relapsed or Refractory T-Cell Malignancies,Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy remains to be investigated in T-cell malignancies. CD7 is an ideal target for T-cell malignancies but is also expressed on normal T cells__ which may cause CAR-T cell fratricide. Donor-derived anti-CD7 CAR-T cells using endoplasmic reticulum retention have shown efficacy in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we launched a phase I trial to explore differences between autologous and allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR-T therapies in T-cell ALL and lymphoma. Ten patients were treated and 5 received autologous CAR-T therapies. No dose-limiting toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. Grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 7 patients__ and grade 3 in 1 patient. Grade 1-2 graft-versus-host diseases were observed in 2 patients. Seven patients had bone marrow infiltration__ and 100% of them achieved complete remission with negative minimal residual disease within one month. Two-fifths of patients achieved extramedullary or extranodular remission. The median follow-up was 6 (range__ 2.7- 14) months and bridging transplantation was not administrated. Patients treated with allogeneic CAR-T cells had higher remission rate__ less recurrence and more durable CAR-T survival than those receiving autologous products. Allogeneic CAR-T cells appeared to be a better option for patients with T-cell malignancies.,GSE227828,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/25

However__ the mechanism of protective immunity in mild cases and the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 remain unclear. On the other hand__ it has been proposed that the potent anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids are beneficial to decrease the fatality rate in severe COVID-19 patients but its specific mechanism is still in debate.,GSE188172,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/24
Human CCR6+ Th cells show both an extended stable gradient of Th17 activity and imprinted plasticity [Spsingh-10x-TCR-plus-transcriptome-kit],Th17 cells have been investigated in mice primarily for their contributions to autoimmune diseases. However__ the pathways of differentiation of Th17 and related Th cells (type 17 cells) and the structure of the type 17 memory population in humans are not well understood; such understanding is critical for manipulating these cells in vivo. By exploiting differences in levels of surface CCR6__ we found that human type 17 memory cells__ including individual T cell clonotypes__ form an elongated continuum of type 17 character along which cells can be driven by increasing RORt. This continuum includes cells preserved within the memory pool with potentials that reflect the early preferential activation of multiple over single lineages. The CCR6+ cells’ phenotypes and epigenomes are stable across cell divisions under homeostatic-like conditions. Nonetheless__ activation in polarizing and non-polarizing conditions can yield additional functionalities__ revealing__ respectively__ both environmentally induced and imprinted mechanisms that contribute differentially across the continuum to yield the unusual plasticity ascribed to type 17 cells.,GSE227656,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/03/20

Porcine anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin depletes the lymphocyte population to promote successful kidney transplantation,Porcine anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (pALG) has been used in kidney transplantation__ but its impacts on the lymphocyte cell pool remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 12 kidney transplant recipients receiving pALG__ and additional recipients receiving rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG)__ basiliximab__ or no induction therapy as a comparison group. pALG showed high binding affinity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after administration__ immediately depleting blood lymphocytes; an effect that was weaker than rATG but stronger than basiliximab. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that pALG mainly influenced T cells and innate immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils). By analyzing immune cell subsets__ we found that pALG moderately depleted CD4+T cells__ CD8+T cells__ regulatory T cells and NKT cells and mildly inhibited dendritic cells. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-2__ IL-6) were only moderately increased compared with rATG__ which might be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of untoward immune activation. During 3 months of follow-up__ we found that all recipients and transplanted kidneys survived and showed good organ function recovery; there were no cases of rejection and a low rate of complications. In conclusion__ pALG acts mainly by moderately depleting T cells and is thus a good candidate for induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients. The immunological features of pALG should be exploited for the development of individually-optimized induction therapies based on the needs of the transplant and the immune status of the patient__ which is appropriate for non-high-risk recipients.,GSE226328,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/01
Cytotoxic T cells targeting spike glycoprotein are associated with hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2,mRNA vaccination of individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides superior protection against breakthrough infections with variants of concern compared to vaccination in the absence of prior infection. However__ the immune mechanisms by which this ‘hybrid immunity’ is generated and maintained are unknown. While genetic variation in spike glycoprotein effectively subverts neutralizing antibodies__ spike-specific T cells are generally maintained against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus__ we comprehensively profiled T cell responses against the S1 and S2 domains of spike glycoprotein in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive or convalescent individuals who received two-dose mRNA vaccine series and were matched by age__ sex__ and vaccine type. Using flow cytometry__ we observed that the overall functional breadth of CD4 T cells as well as polyfunctional Th1 responses were similar between the two groups. However__ polyfunctional cytotoxic CD4 T cell responses against both S1 and S2 domains trended higher among convalescent subjects. Multi-modal single-cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse functional programs in spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in both groups. However__ convalescent individuals displayed enhanced cytotoxic and antiviral CD8 T cell responses to both S1 and S2 in the absence of cytokine production. Taken together__ our data suggest that cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells targeting spike glycoprotein may partially account for hybrid immunity and protection against breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2.,GSE223236,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/01
Augmenting SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induced spike protein-specific CD4+ T cell responses through IL-1β and its receptors.,Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection provided by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines decline over time. Thus__ there is a need for interventions to augment and sustain such immunity. To address this__ we characterized S protein-specific CD4+ T cells in healthy individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines utilizing high-dimensional single cell RNA-seq and mass cytometry. S protein-specific CD4+ T cells highly expressed IL-1 receptor (R) 1 and its decoy receptor IL-1R2. IL-1b promoted IFN-g expression by S protein-stimulated CD4+ T cells__ which was furthered by adding anti-IL-1R2-blocking antibodies__ supporting the functional implications of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2. Following the 2nd dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine__ IL-1R1 expression increased while IL-1R2 expression decreased in S protein-specific CD4+ T cells. Our findings provide novel insight into augmenting COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell immunity by modulating IL-1β and its receptor system__ which could foster a more effective and prolonged immune response.,GSE206134,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/03/01

Discussion Our findings illustrate the induction of a unique myeloid subset in COVID19 vaccination-associated encephalitis. Further accumulation of reports investigating the dysregulated immune signature of COVID19 vaccination-associated autoimmunity is warranted to clarify the pathogenic role of the myeloid subset observed in our study.,GSE205606,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/02/20

Dormant leukemia stem cells reinforced by chemotherapy drive early treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia patients [scRNA_PT],Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by a minor fraction of primitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that sustain disease propagation and may be at the origin of late relapse. Yet__ LSC contribution to early therapy resistance and AML regeneration remains controversial. We prospectively identified LSCs in NPM1-mutated AML patients and xenografts by means of a microRNA-126 reporter and single cell RNA sequencing__ precisely discriminating LSCs from regenerating hematopoiesis__ and assessed their longitudinal response to chemotherapy. We here show that chemotherapy resulted in distinct outcomes within AML subpopulations: while the bulk leukemia proliferated and differentiated with expression of oxidative-phosphorylation signatures__ persisting miR-126high LSCs enforced protective stemness and dormancy features__ along with a generalized inflammatory and senescence-associated response. miR-126high LSCs were enriched at diagnosis in patients with chemotherapy-refractory AML. We derived a novel miR-126high LSC transcriptional signature__ which robustly stratified patients for overall survival in large AML cohorts__ shining the spotlight on LSCs as determinants of early therapy resistance.,GSE185991,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/02/06
Single-cell transcriptomic changes in sepsis patient,Sepsis is a syndromic response to infection and is frequently a final common pathway to death from many infectious diseases worldwide. The global burden of sepsis is difficult to ascertain__ although a recent scientific publication estimated that there were 48.9 million cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths worldwide__ which accounted for almost 20% of all global deaths. Here we analyzed the whole blood transcriptome of 5 healthy controls and 5 patients with confirmed sepsis from the Department of Emergency__ Division of Surgical critical care__ Tongji Trauma Center__ Tongji Hospital__ Tongji Medical College. This research aims to understand the expression of immune cells in sepsis patients and to construct an immune cell landscape of sepsis.,GSE224095,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/02/05

Clonal dynamics of alloreactive T cells in kidney allograft rejection after anti-PD-1 therapy [Non-naive CD8 single-cell],Kidney transplant recipients are at particular risk for developing tumors__ many of which are now routinely treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); however__ ICI therapy can precipitate transplant rejection. We utilized TCR sequencing to identify and track alloreactive T cells in a patient with melanoma who experienced kidney transplant rejection following ICI therapy. ICI therapy was associated with a sharp increase in circulating alloreactive CD8+ T cell clones__ many of which were also detected in the rejected kidney but not at tumor sites.

Immune landscape in ER+ breast cancer subtypes identifies a differential role for macrophages,Current immunotherapies are ineffective for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers__ which account for nearly 70% of all breast cancers. Amongst the ER+ breast cancers__ the major subtypes are invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). We utilized droplet-based single-cell RNAseq (10X Genomics) to analyzed the immune landscape of both peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating immune populations in both IDC and ILC. These analyses demonstrated substantial heterogeneity of macrophage within the tumor microenvironment.,GSE193911,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/01/29
Single-cell clonal tracking of persistent T-cells in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,The critical balance between intended and adverse effects in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) depends on the fate of individual donor T‐cells. To this end__ we tracked αβT‐cell clones during stem cell mobilization treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in healthy donors and during immune reconstitution after transfer to transplant recipients. More than 250 αβT‐cell clones were tracked from donor to recipient. These clones consisted almost exclusively of CD8+ effector memory T cells (CD8TEM)__ which exhibited a different transcriptional signature with enhanced effector and cytotoxic functions compared to other CD8TEM. Importantly__ these distinct and persisting clones could already be delineated in the donor. We confirmed these phenotypes on the protein level and their potential for selection from the graft. Thus__ we identified a transcriptional signature associated with persistence and expansion of donor T-cell clones after alloHSCT that may be exploited for personalized graft manipulation strategies in future studies.,GSE222633,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/01/27
Comparative analysis of innate immune responses to viral infection among animals,Bats harbour various viruses without severe symptoms and act as natural reservoirs. This tolerance of bats toward viral infections is assumed to be originated from the uniqueness of their immune system. However__ how the innate immune response varies between primates and bats remains unclear. To illuminate differences in innate immune responses among animal species__ we performed a comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four species including Egyptian fruit bats inoculated with various infectious stimuli.,GSE218199,Rousettus aegyptiacus; Macaca mulatta; Homo sapiens; Pan troglodytes,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/01/18

T cell cellular stress and reticulocyte signatures__ but not loss of naïve T lymphocytes__ characterize severe COVID-19 in older adults,In children and younger adults up to 39 years of age__ SARS-CoV-2 usually elicits mild symptoms that resemble the common cold. Disease severity increases with age starting at 30 and reaches astounding mortality rates that are ~330 fold higher in persons above 85 years of age compared to those 18-39 years old. To understand age-specific immune pathobiology of COVID-19 we have analyzed soluble mediators__ cellular phenotypes__ and transcriptome from over 80 COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease severity__ carefully controlling for age as a variable. We found that reticulocyte numbers and peripheral blood transcriptional signatures robustly correlated with disease severity. By contrast__ decreased numbers and proportion of naïve T cells__ reported previously as a COVID-19 severity risk factor__ were found to be general features of aging and not of COVID-19 severity__ as they readily occurred in older participants experiencing only mild or no disease at all. Single-cell transcriptional signatures across age and severity groups showed that severe but not moderate/mild COVID-19 causes cell stress response in different T cell populations__ and some of that stress was unique to old severe participants__ suggesting that in severe disease of older adults__ these defenders of the organism may be disabled from performing immune protection. These findings shed new light on interactions between age and disease severity in COVID-19.,GSE212584,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2023/01/11
Time-resolved assessment of single-cell protein secretion by sequencing,Secreted proteins play critical roles in cellular communication. Methods enabling concurrent measurement of cellular protein secretion__ phenotypes and transcriptomes are still unavailable. Here__ we describe Time-Resolved Assessment of Protein Secretion from single cells by sequencing (TRAPS-seq). Released proteins are trapped onto cell surface and probed by oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies before simultaneously sequenced with transcriptomes in single cells. TRAPS-seq unravels the phenotypic and transcriptional determinants of the secretion of pleiotropic Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ__ IL-2 and TNF-α) in activated T cells. We further demonstrate the use of TRAPS-seq to track dynamic secretion of multiple cytokines over time__ uncovering unique molecular signatures that govern the preservation or transition of single-cell cytokine secretions. Our results revealed that early central memory T cells with CD45RA expression (TCMRA) are important in both the production and maintenance of polyfunctional cytokines. TRAPS-seq presents a unique tool for seamless integration of secretomics measurement with multi-omics profiling in single cells.,GSE200690,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/01/11

Mapping genetic effects on cell type-specific chromatin accessibility and annotating complex trait variants using single nucleus ATAC-seq,Gene regulation is highly cell type-specific and understanding the function of non-coding genetic variants associated with complex traits requires molecular phenotyping at cell type resolution. In this study we performed single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and genotyping in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 individuals. Clustering chromatin accessibility profiles of 96__002 total nuclei identified 17 immune cell types and sub-types. We mapped chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in each immune cell type and sub-type which identified ~6__000 total caQTL peaks__ including those obscured from assays of bulk tissue such as with divergent effects on different cell types. For ~3__000 caQTLs we further annotated putative target genes of variant activity using single cell co-accessibility__ and caQTL variants were significantly correlated with the accessibility level of linked gene promoters. We fine-mapped loci associated with 16 complex immune traits and identified immune cell caQTLs__ including those with cell type-specific effects. At the 6q15 locus associated with type 1 diabetes__ in line with previous reports__ variant rs72928038 was a naïve CD4+ T cell caQTL linked to BACH2 and we validated the allelic effects of this variant on regulatory activity in Jurkat T cells. These results highlight the utility of snATAC-seq for mapping genetic effects on accessible chromatin in specific cell types and provide a resource for annotating complex immune trait loci.,GSE199253,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Third-party reanalysis,2023/01/10
Influenza vaccination reveals sex dimorphic imprints of prior mild COVID-19 [single-cell CITEseq],"Acute viral infections can have durable functional impacts on the immune system long after recovery__ but how they affect homeostatic immune states and responses to future perturbations remain poorly understood. Here we use systems immunology approaches__ including longitudinal multimodal single cell analysis (surface proteins__ transcriptome__ and V(D)J sequences)__ to comparatively assess baseline immune statuses and responses to influenza vaccination in 33 healthy individuals after recovery from mild__ non-hospitalized COVID-19 (mean: 151 days after diagnosis) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls who never had COVID-19. At baseline and independent of time since COVID-19__ recoverees had elevated T-cell activation signatures and lower expression of innate immune genes in monocytes. COVID-19-recovered males had coordinately higher innate__ influenza-specific plasmablast__ and antibody responses after vaccination compared to healthy male and COVID-19-recovered females__ partly because male recoverees had monocytes with higher IL-15 responses early after vaccination coupled with elevated pre-vaccination frequencies of ""virtual memory"" like CD8+ T-cells poised to produce more IFNg upon IL-15 stimulation. In addition__ the expression of the repressed innate immune genes in monocytes increased by day 1 through day 28 post-vaccination in recoverees__ thus moving towards the pre-vaccination baseline of healthy controls. In contrast__ these genes decreased on day 1 and returned to the baseline by day 28 in controls. Our study reveals sex-dimorphic impacts of prior mild COVID-19 and suggests that viral infections in humans can establish new immunological set-points impacting future immune responses in an antigen-agnostic manner.",GSE206265,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/01/04
Transcriptomic profile of single-cell sorted CD14+ monocytes from 6 PBMC samples of individuals with active tuberculosis,Previous studies suggest that monocytes are an important contributor to tuberculosis (TB)-specific immune signatures in blood. Here we carried out single-cell profiling of classical CD14+CD16- and intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes in paired blood samples of active TB (ATB) patients at diagnosis and end-treatment. At diagnosis__ ATB patients displayed upregulation of interferon signaling genes that significantly overlapped with previously reported blood TB signatures in both CD14+ subsets. In ATB diagnosis__ we identified additional transcriptomic and functional changes in intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes__ such as the upregulation of inflammatory and MHC-II genes__ and increased capacity to activate T cells__ reflecting overall increased activation in this population. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that distinct subsets of intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes were responsible for each gene signature__ indicating significant functional heterogeneity within this population. Finally__ we observed that transcriptomic changes in CD14+ monocytes were transient__ as they were no longer observed in the same ATB patients mid-treatment__ suggesting they are associated with disease resolution.,GSE214237,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2023/01/02
Lineage tracing identifies cutaneous lymphoid progenitor common for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome,Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that originate in the skin__ with mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) representing the most common variants. The cellular origin of cutaneous lymphomas has remained controversial due to their immense phenotypic heterogeneity that obfuscates lineage reconstruction based on classical surface biomarkers. To overcome this heterogeneity and reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of malignant cells in MF and SS__ T-cell receptor sequencing was performed in parallel with targeted transcriptomics at the single-cell resolution. Unsupervised lineage reconstruction discovered that peripheral Sézary cells emerged from CD4+ T cells similar to those in patch MF__ but this developmental pathway was mutually exclusive with MF plaque and tumor progression. Furthermore__ Sézary cells phenotypically comprised at least three subsets based on differential proliferation potential and expression of exhausted markers. Collectively__ these findings provide evidence that asymmetric differentiation of cutaneous lymphoid progenitors can lead to cutaneous progression into plaque/tumor MF__ or alternatively give rise to the leukemic cells of SS.,GSE192836,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/31
scONE-seq: A one-tube single-cell multi-omics method enables simultaneous dissection of genotype and phenotype heterogeneity from frozen tumor samples,Both the genotypic and phenotypic cellular heterogeneity play important roles in normal tissue function as well as disease development. To be able to characterize these different forms of cellular heterogeneity in diverse types of samples__ we developed scONE-seq__ which enables simultaneous transcriptome and genome profiling in a one-tube reaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of scONE-seq by benchmarking it against existing methods using cell lines and lymphocytes from a healthy donor. Furthermore__ we applied scONE-seq to a frozen years-old IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM) sample and profiled over 1200 nuclei from a single sample__ subsequently identifying a phenotypically normal-like tumor clone that was only distinguishable by superimposing paired clonal and transcriptomic data.,GSE185269,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/12/31
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the molecular features of peripheral blood immune cells in children__ adults and centenarians,The molecular and functional characteristics of peripheral blood immune cells in childhood may contribute to the specialized immune system in children. At present__ few researches have compared immune cells in childhood with other age groups__ and there is a lack of understanding of immune cells in childhood from the whole lifespan. To display the molecular characteristics of peripheral blood immune cells in childhood at the single-cell level__ we performed a comparative study by constructing a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) atlas of multiple age groups__ including children__ young adults__ middle-aged adults__ aged adults and supercentenarians. The atlas revealed that monocytes in childhood were markedly different from those in other periods. B cells in childhood had a greater ability to respond to viruses and to activate mast cells. Remarkably__ we identified a new subtype of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells expressing both naïve and cytotoxicity genes specifically in childhood. The marker genes of this subtypes were used as marker proteins for flow cytometry analysis__ and the results confirmed the findings of the scRNA-seq. Moreover__ there was more frequent crosstalk between PBMCs in childhood than in other periods__ which may be one of the characteristics of the immune system in childhood. Finally__ the differences in the expression of susceptibility genes in the PBMCs of different age groups may indicate differences in the disease spectrum of different age groups. In conclusion__ this research systematically described the molecular characteristics of peripheral blood immune cells in childhood from multiple levels__ and provided new evidence to elucidate the special immune environment of childhood.,GSE206295,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/30

Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 persist in the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue of children,SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers adaptive immune responses from both T and B cells. However__ most studies focus on peripheral blood__ which may not fully reflect immune responses in lymphoid tissues at the site of infection. To evaluate both local and systemic adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2__ we collected peripheral blood__ tonsils__ and adenoids from 110 children undergoing tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to investigate the adaptive immune response locally__ we measured the neutralizing antibodies against to multiple SARS-CoV-2 virus variants and performed high dimensional flow cytometry and CITEseq including TCR and BCR analysis for deeper characterization of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In our CITE-seq analyses__ we sorted SARS-CoV-2 S1 (spike 1) binding (Spike1+) and non-binding (Spike1-) CD19+ B cells from tonsils__ adenoids__ and PBMCs from two subjects with a history of COVID-19 and one uninfected control. To assess T cells at the single cell level__ we sorted CD95+ CD4+ and CD95+ CD8+ T cells__ identified expanded T cell clonotypes__ and then compared the CDR3 sequences to those previously reported to recognize SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Our results provide evidence for persistent tissue-specific immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of children weeks to months after acute infection.,GSE215802,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/19
Bacterial membrane phosphatidylglycerols activate a population of human CD1a-restricted t cells,Expressed on epidermal Langerhans cells__ CD1a presents a range of self-lipid antigens found within the skin. However__ the extent to which CD1a presents microbial ligands from skin bacteria is unclear. Here__ we identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)__ a ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid__ as well as to lysyl phosphatidylglycerol (lysylPG)__ a modified PG__ present in the many gram positive bacteria__ and highly abundant in Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically__ PG and lysylPG together constitute the vast majority of the structural membrane lipids in Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-lysylPG complex showed that the acyl chains were buried within the A′- and F′-pockets of CD1a__ while the lysine-modified phosphoglycerol headgroup protruded from the F′-portal and was available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG-loaded CD1a tetramers__ we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to this lipid in a dose dependent manner. Tetramer+ CD4+ T cell lines secreted Th2 cytokines in response to lysylPG as well as to co-cultures of CD1a+ dendritic cells and Staphylococcus aureus. The expansion of CD4+ CD1a-lysylPG tetramer+ T cells in atopic dermatitis patients__ indicates a response to a lipid made by bacteria associated with atopic dermatitis__ and provide a link supporting involvement of PG-based lipid-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of dermatitis.,GSE186459,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/19

Engineered cell entry links receptor biology with single-cell genomics [scRNA-Seq],Cells communicate with each other via receptor-ligand interactions. Here we describe lentiviral-mediated cell e¬ntry by engineered receptor-ligand interaction (ENTER) to display ligand proteins__ deliver payloads__ and record receptor specificity. We optimize ENTER to decode interactions between T cell receptor (TCR)-MHC peptides__ antibody-antigen__ and other receptor-ligand pairs. A viral presentation strategy allows ENTER to capture interactions between B cell receptor and any antigen. We engineer ENTER to deliver genetic payloads to antigen-specific T or B cells to selectively modulate cellular behavior in mixed populations. Single-cell readout of ENTER by RNA-sequencing (ENTER-seq) enables multiplexed enumeration of antigen specificities__ TCR clonality__ cell-type and states of individual T cells. ENTER-seq of CMV-seropositive patient blood samples reveals the viral epitopes that drive effector memory T cell differentiation and inter- vs intra-clonal phenotypic diversity targeting the same epitope. ENTER technology enables systematic discovery of receptor specificity__ linkage to cell fates__ and antigen-specific cargo delivery.,GSE212996,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/12
PRMT5 Promotes Progression of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [scRNA-seq and scVDJ-seq],Purpose: Richter’s Transformation (RT) is a poorly understood and often fatal progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) manifesting histologically as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. PRMT5 is implicated in lymphomagenesis__ but its role in CLL or RT progression is unknown. We demonstrate herein that tumors uniformly overexpress PRMT5 in patients with progression to RT. Furthermore__ mice with B-specific overexpression of hPRMT5 developed a B-lymphoid expansion with increased risk of death__ and Eµ-PRMT5/TCL1 double transgenic mice uniformly developed a highly aggressive disease that histologically resembles RT; where large-scale transcriptional profiling identified unique oncogenic pathways that mediate PRMT5-driven disease progression. Taken together__ the discovery that PRMT5 drives oncogenic pathways promoting RT provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation of PRMT5 inhibitors such as PRT382 in aggressive CLL/RT cases,GSE205704,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/12/07
CD4 + T-cell help explains clinical benefit of specific intra-tumoral dendritic cell states in human cancer,Classical type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) have a low abundance in the tumor microenvironment (TME)__ but positively correlate with patient survival. We hypothesized that the ability of cDC1 to relay CD4+ T-cell help for the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response explains their clinical benefit. In vitro__ contact with activated CD4+ T-cells enabled human cDC1__ but no other DC types__ to induce a CTL response to cell-associated tumor antigens. Single cell transcriptomics revealed that CD4+ T-cell help uniquely optimized cDC1 and no other DC types in many functions that support antigen cross-presentation and T-cell priming. We robustly identified “helped” cDC1 in a multitude of human cancer types by the overlap in their transcriptomic signature with that of recently defined__ positively prognostic tumor-infiltrating DC states. As predicted from the functional effects of CD4+ T-cell help__ the transcriptomic signature of “helped” cDC1 correlated with tumor infiltration by CTL and Thelper(h)-1 cells__ overall survival and response to PD-1-targeting immunotherapy. These findings reveal a critical role of CD4+ T-cell help delivery via cDC1 to CTL in the TME,GSE218719,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/02
Early response evaluation by single cell signaling profiling in acute myeloid leukemia ,Aberrant pro-survival signaling is a hallmark of cancer cells__ but the response to chemotherapy is poorly understood. In this study__ we investigate the initial signaling response to standard induction chemotherapy in a cohort of 32 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients__ using 36-dimensional mass cytometry. Through supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches__ we find that reduction of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in the myeloid cell compartment 24h post-chemotherapy is a significant predictor of patient 5-year overall survival in this cohort. Validation by RNA sequencing show induction of MAPK target gene expression in patients with high phospho-ERK1/2 24h post-chemotherapy__ while proteomics confirms an increase of the p38 prime target MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2). In this study__ we demonstrate that mass cytometry can be a valuable tool for early response evaluation in AML and elucidate the potential of functional signaling analyses in precision oncology diagnostics.,GSE218664,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/12/02

IL-4 receptor blockade is a global repressor of naïve B cell development and responses in a dupilumab-treated patient,Here__ we report a case of atopic dermatitis (AD) in a patient who received biweekly doses of dupilumab__ an antibody against the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα). Single cell RNA-sequencing showed that naïve B cells expressed the highest levels of IL4R compared to other B cell subpopulations. Compared to controls__ the dupilumab-treated patient exhibited diminished percentages of IL4R+IGHD+ naïve B cells and down-regulation of IL4R__ FCER2 (CD23)__ and IGHD. Dupilumab treatment resulted in upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and inhibition of B cell receptor signaling and down-regulation of class-switch and memory B cell development genes. The dupilumab-treated patient exhibited a rapid decline in COVID-19 anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies between 4 and 8 and 11 months post COVID-19 vaccination. Our data suggest that intact and persistent IL-4 signaling is necessary for maintaining robust survival and development of naïve B cells__ and maintaining a long term vaccine response.,GSE193096,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/11/21
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of pre- and post-treatment periodontitis patients and healthy donors by single-cell RNA profiling,The pathogenic determinants of chronic periodontitis leading to extra-oral comorbidity are unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the main determinants that correlate chronic periodontitis and systemic diseases via periodontitis-evoked molecular changes in immune cells resolved by therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed to compare the molecular and biological differences in immune cells of 4 pre- and 4 post-treatment patients and 4 healthy donors. Periodontal treatment was one-day full-arch scaling and root planning for full mouth disinfection. Altered expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response in the patients was compared with that in healthy donors following therapeutic intervention. The common representative genes across diverse cell types were investigated; those genes were associated with periodontitis-pathogenic bacterial systemic diseases. These important factors correlating chronic periodontitis and systemic inflammatory diseases at the single-cell level may serve as therapeutic targets.,GSE174609,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/11/09

DUSP6 mediates resistance to JAK2 inhibition and drives leukemic progression (microarray),Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)__ for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood__ resulting in limited treatment options and dismal clinical outcomes. Here__ we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases__ identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling__ resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation__ while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore__ ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance__ while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically__ DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1__ which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality__ whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment. Finally__ pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 potently and specifically suppressed disease development across Jak2 V617F and MPL W515L MPN mouse models__ as well as sAML PDXs__ without inducing toxicity in healthy controls. These findings underscore DUSP6 in driving disease transformation and therapeutic resistance__ and highlight the DUSP6-RSK1 axis as a novel__ druggable pathway in myeloid malignancies.,GSE214360,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by array,2022/10/25
Gene expression profile at single cell level of PBMC from a CID patient (P) caused by IRF4 p.T95R heterozygous mutation and an age-matched healthy control (HC),To assess the global changes in PBMC subsets distribution and gene expresion of a CID patient (P) caused by IRF4 p.T95R heterozygous mutation__ we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBMC isolated from P and HC,GSE215938,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/24
Systemic Alterations in Type-2 Conventional Dendritic Cells Lead to Impaired Tumor Immunity in Pancreatic Cancer,Intratumoral T-cell dysfunction is a hallmark of pancreatic tumors__ and efforts to improve dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T-cell activation may be critical in treating these immune therapy unresponsive tumors. Recent evidence indicates that mechanisms that induce dysfunction of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1) in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are drivers of the lack of responsiveness to checkpoint immunotherapy. However__ the impact of PDAC on systemic type 2 cDC2 development and function has not been well studied. Herein__ we report the analysis of 3 cohorts__ totaling 106 samples__ of human blood and bone marrow (BM) from patients with PDAC for changes in cDCs. We found that circulating cDC2s and their progenitors were significantly decreased in the blood of patients with PDAC__ and repressed numbers of cDC2s were associated with poor prognosis. Serum cytokine analyses identified IL6 as significantly elevated in patients with PDAC and negatively correlated with cDC numbers. In vitro__ IL6 impaired the differentiation of cDC1s and cDC2s from BM progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human cDC progenitors in the BM and blood of patients with PDAC showed an upregulation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway and a corresponding impairment of antigen processing and presentation. These results suggested that cDC2s were systemically suppressed by inflammatory cytokines__ which was linked to impaired antitumor immunity.,GSE213096,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/21
Clinical and immunological signatures of severe COVID-19 in previously healthy patients with clonal hematopoiesis,Many clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19__ such as diabetes__ hypertension__ and high body mass index have been reported. However__ searching for additional risk factors should be continued to predict the progression of severe COVID-19 more accurately. We suppose that clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can also be regarded as one of risk factors. To identify the influence of CHIP in COVID-19 pathogenesis__ we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from severe COVID-19 patient with CHIP and integrate the data with other published COVID-19 scRNA seq data (GSE149689). After clustering and annotating cell types__ we compare the expression profiles between CHIP vs non-CHIP COVID-19 severe patient.,GSE182123,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/19
Single-cell RNA sequencing of immune landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sintilimab and sorafenib,Checkpoint inhibitors combined with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment have achieved satisfactory results in many clinical trials. Understanding the mechanism underlying this modality may provide better strategies to eradicate HCC. In the present study__ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients who received combination sintilimab and sorafenib treatment were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).,GSE215428,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/17
Single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of patient with ARPC5 deficiency and healthy control,We performed a targeted scRNA-seq approach using the BD Rhapsody™ Single Cell Analysis Systems (BD Biosciences). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with sample tags (BD Human Single Cell Multiplexing Kit) and AbSeq antibodies (CD1c__ CD3__ CD4__ CD5__ CD8__ CD11c__ CD14__ CD16__ CD18__ CD19__ CD20__ CD21__ CD23__ CD24__ CD25__ CD27__ CD28__ CD31__ CD38__ CD40__ CD44__ CD45RA__ CD45RO__ CD56__ CD62L__ CD123__ CD127__ CD134__ CD137__ CD161__ CD183__ CD185__ CD186__ CD196__ CD197__ CD272__ CD278__ CD279__ CD303__ CD314__ CD337__ CD357__ CD366__ HLA-DR__ IgD__ IgM__ TCRαβ__ TCRγ8__ Vα24-Jα18) and counted. Single-cell capture was performed using the BD Rhapsody Express following manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were pooled and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 S2 as a dual index pair-end run. Fastq files were processed using BD's Rhapsody analysis pipeline on the Seven Bridges Platform using default parameters__ the GRCh38-PhiX-gencodev29 reference genome and the gencodev29-20181205 transcriptome annotation. Data (molecules per gene per cell based on DBEC error correction) were analyzed using BD SeqGeq v1.8 and the Seurat plug-in to perform dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and differential analysis output for selected cell subsets (CD4+ T cells__ CD8+ T cells__ NK cells__ NKT cells__ classical monocytes__ intermediate monocytes__ non-classical monocytes).,GSE215451,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/10/16
IFN-λ treatment accelerates SARS-CoV-2 clearance despite age-related delays in the induction of T cell immunity,Interferons (IFNs) induced early after SARS-CoV-2 infection are crucial for shaping immunity and preventing severe COVID-19. We previously demonstrated that injection of pegylated interferon-lambda1 (PEG-IFN-λ) accelerated viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. To determine if the viral decline was mediated by enhanced immunity__ we assessed in vivo responses to PEG-IFN-λ by single cell RNA sequencing and measured SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and antibody responses between placebo and PEG-IFN-λ-treated patients. PEG-IFN-λ treatment induced interferon stimulated genes in peripheral immune cells expressing IFNLR1__ including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. PEG-IFN-λ did not affect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels or the magnitude of virus-specific T cells. However__ we identified delayed T cell responses in older adults__ suggesting that PEG-IFN-λ can overcome delays in adaptive immunity to accelerate viral clearance in high-risk patients. Altogether__ PEG-IFN-λ offers an early COVID-19 treatment option for outpatients to boost innate antiviral defenses without dampening peripheral adaptive immunity.,GSE215814,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/14
A human STAT3 gain-of-function variant confers T cell dysregulation without predominant Treg dysfunction in mice [single cell RNA-seq],Primary immune regulatory disorders (PIRD) are a group of disorders characterized by immune dysregulation__ presenting with a wide range of clinical disease including autoimmunity__ autoinflammation__ or lymphoproliferation. Autosomal dominant germline gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 result in a PIRD with a broad spectrum of clinical features and prior studies have documented a decreased frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and an increased frequency of Th17 cells is some patients. However__ the precise mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in STAT3 GOF syndrome remain largely unknown. We developed a knock-in mouse model harboring a de novo pathogenic human STAT3 variant (p.G421R) and found these mice developed T cell dysregulation__ lymphoproliferation and CD4+ Th1 cell skewing. Surprisingly__ Treg cell numbers__ phenotype__ and function remained largely intact__ however mice had a selective deficiency in the generation of iTreg cells. In parallel__ we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF syndrome. We demonstrate only minor changes in the Treg cell transcriptional signature and an expanded__ effector CD8+ T cell population. Together__ these finding suggest Treg cells are not the primary driver of disease and highlight the importance of preclinical models in the study of disease mechanisms in rare PIRD.,GSE207935,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/14
HIV specific CD8+ Trm-like cells in tonsils express exhaustive signatures in the absence of natural HIV control [Seqwell],Lymphoid tissues are an important HIV reservoir site that persists in the face of antiretroviral therapy and natural immunity. Targeting these reservoirs by harnessing the antiviral activity of local tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T-cells is of great interest__ but limited data exist on TRM-like cells within lymph nodes of people living with HIV (PLWH). Here__ we studied tonsil CD8+ T-cells obtained from PLWH and uninfected controls from South Africa. We show that these cells are preferentially located outside the germinal centers (GCs)__ the main reservoir site for HIV__ and display a low cytolytic and transcriptionally TRMlike profile distinct from blood CD8+ T-cells. In PLWH__ CD8+ TRM-like cells are highly expanded and adopt a more cytolytic__ activated__ and exhausted phenotype not reversed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). This phenotype was enhanced in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells from tonsils compared to matched blood suggesting a higher antigen burden in tonsils. Single-cell transcriptional and clonotype resolution showed that these HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in the tonsils express heterogeneous signatures of T-cell activation__ clonal expansion__ and exhaustion ex-vivo. Interestingly__ this signature was absent in a natural HIV controller__ who expressed lower PD-1 and CXCR5 levels and reduced transcriptional evidence of T-cell activation__ exhaustion__ and cytolytic activity. These data provide important insights into lymphoid tissue-derived HIVspecific CD8+ TRM-like phenotypes in settings of HIV remission and highlight their potential for immunotherapy and targeting of the HIV reservoirs.,GSE215125,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/12
Comprehensive multi-omics single-cell data integration reveals greater heterogeneity in the human immune system,Single-cell transcriptomics enables the definition of diverse human immune cell types across multiple tissue and disease contexts. Still__ deeper biological understanding requires comprehensive integration of multiple single-cell -omics (transcriptomic__ proteomic__ and cell receptor repertoire). To improve the identification of diverse cell types and the accuracy of cell-type classification in our datasets__ we developed SuPERR-seq__ a novel analysis workflow to increase the resolution and accuracy of clustering and allow for the discovery and characterization of previously hidden cell subsets. We show that by incorporating information from cell-surface proteins and immunoglobulin transcript counts__ we accurately remove cell doublets__ and prevent widespread cell-type misclassification. This approach uniquely improves identification of heterogenous cell types in the human immune system__ including a novel subset of antibody-secreting cells in the bone marrow.,GSE181543,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/10/05
Single cell RNAseq reveal covid19 vaccine response difference,Single cell RNAseq was performed on PBMC isolated from health workers who received two doses of Pfizer COVID19 vaccine and determined as either normal responders or low responders by antibody test.

GM-CSF-induced CD40high human blood dendritic cells promote Tfh1 polarization,Using single-cell RNA sequencing (10X technology) on CD4+T cells__ we report that GM-CSF-activated human blood CD1c+ dendritic cells (DC) (cDC2) drive the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Tfh1. These Tfh1 cells displayed typical Tfh molecular features__ including high levels of PD-1__ CXCR5__ and ICOS. They co-expressed Bcl6 and T-bet__ and secreted large amounts of IL-21 and IFN-γ.,GSE167364,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/10/01
Distinct immunological and molecular signatures predict influenza vaccine responsiveness in the elderly (scRNA Seq),The significant economic burden and high mortality rates resulting from seasonal influenza outbreaks__ especially in high risk groups such as the elderly__ represent an important public health problem. The prevailing inadequate efficacy of seasonal vaccines__ both conventional and elderly-tailored__ is a crucial bottleneck. Consequentially__ understanding immunological and molecular mechanisms resulting in differential influenza vaccine responsiveness is a prerequisite for the development of new or improved vaccination strategies. To assess differences within the specific risk group of the elderly__ randomly selected individuals (≥ 65 years) were immunized with the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad®. Samples were subjected to single cell transcriptome analysis. The analyses revealed profound features segregating vaccine responders from nonresponders as classified according to their vaccine-induced sero-conversion. Non-responders are characterized by a poorly functional__ suppressive phenotype__ showing a weaker humoral and cellular immune activation and more suppressive regulatory T and B cells. Triple responders display an efficient immune functionality characterized by the activation of humoral and cellular immunity and the up-regulation of genes related to signaling pathways__ including those for anti-viral responses__ protein processing and B cell activation. The generated comprehensive high dimensional dataset enables the identification of putative mechanisms and nodes responsible for vaccine non-responsiveness regardless of confounding age-dependent effects.,GSE211560,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/29
Single-Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Human Hepatic ILCs Reveals the Enrichment of ILC2 in Liver Cancer,Here__ we show the scRNA-seq-based analysis of 9 ILC samples sorted by flow cytometry__ from blood__ healthy livers__ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors__ and HCC tumor-adjacent liver tissues. Unbiased transcriptional clustering revealed seven distinct ILC subpopulations in healthy liver and six in liver cancer__ among which there were two tissue-resident NK cell subpopulations (CXCR6+CD16+ and CXCR6+CD16-) in healthy liver but only one tissue-resident NK cell subpopulation (CXCR6+CD16-) in tumor tissues. Notably__ ILC2s were significantly accumulated in the HCC tissues__ and bulk RNA sequencing of SLAMF1+ ILC2s and SLAMF1- ILC2s identified their function.,GSE162616,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/26

Nanobody-tethered transposition enables multifactorial chromatin profiling at single-cell resolution,Chromatin states are functionally defined by a complex combination of histone modifications__ transcription factor binding__ DNA accessibility__ and other factors. However__ most current single-cell-resolution methods are unable to measure more than one aspect of chromatin state in a single experiment__ limiting our ability to accurately measure chromatin states. Here__ we introduce nanobody-tethered transposition followed by sequencing (NTT-seq)__ a new assay capable of measuring the genome-wide presence of multiple histone modifications and protein-DNA binding sites at single-cell resolution. NTT-seq utilizes recombinant Tn5 transposase fused to a set of secondary nanobodies (nb). Each nb-Tn5 fusion protein specifically binds to different immunoglobulin-G antibodies__ enabling a mixture of primary antibodies binding different epitopes to be used in a single experiment. We apply bulk- and single-cell NTT-seq to generate high-resolution multimodal maps of chromatin states in cell culture and cells of the human immune system__ demonstrating the high accuracy and sensitivity of the method. We further extend NTT-seq to enable simultaneous profiling of cell-surface protein expression alongside multimodal chromatin states to study cells of the immune system.,GSE212588,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/21
Single-cell sequencing reveals effects of chemotherapy on the immune landscape and TCR/BCR clonal expansion in a relapsed ovarian cancer patient,Cancer recurrence and chemoresistance are the leading causes of death in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. However__ the unique role of the immune environment in tumor progression for relapsed chemo-resistant patients remains elusive. In single-cell resolution__ we characterized a comprehensive multi-dimensional cellular and immunological atlas from tumor__ ascites__ and peripheral blood of a chemo-resistant patient at different stages of treatment. Our results highlight a role in recurrence and chemoresistance of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in ascites__ including MDSC-like myeloid and hypo-metabolic γδT cells__ and of peripheral CD8+ effector T cells with chemotherapy-induced senescent/exhaustive. Importantly__ paired TCR/BCR sequencing demonstrated relative conservation of TCR clonal expansion in hyper-expanded CD8+ T cells and extensive BCR clonal expansion without usage bias of V(D)J genes after chemotherapy. Thus__ our study suggests strategies for ameliorating chemotherapy-induced immune impairment to improve the clinical outcome of HGSOC.,GSE213243,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/09/15
Characterization of B-cell receptor repertoire associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections of SARS-CoV-2,The immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections are very complex and remain to be further characterized. In this study__ we performed the single-cell B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing (scBCR-seq) of the PBMC samples from the healthy controls and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with various clinical presentations__ and subsequently analyzed the abundance__ diversity and difference of BCR repertoire in different groups of COVID-19 patients and the healthy controls__ respectively. We identified a number of unique heavy or light chain VDJ genes pairs and combinational preference in each group__ such as IGKV3-7 enriched in the asymptomatic subjects__ whereas IGHV3-23-IGHJ4__ IGHV1-18–IGLV3-19__ IGHV1-18–IGLV3-21__ and IGHV1-1–IGLV3-25 enriched in the recovery patients from the severe diseases. These findings may advance our understanding of the B-cell mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections and help develop novel vaccine candidates and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19.,GSE180118,Homo sapiens,Other,2022/09/15
Acute exercise mobilizes NKT-like cells with a cytotoxic transcriptomic profile but does not augment the potency of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells,CD3+/CD56+ Natural killer (NK) cell-like T-cells (NKT-like cells) represent <5% of blood lymphocytes__ display a cytotoxic phenotype__ and can kill various cancers. NKT-like cells can be expanded ex vivo into cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells__ however this therapeutic cell product has had mixed results against hematological malignancies in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine if NKT-like cells mobilized during acute cycling exercise could be used to generate more potent anti-tumor CIK cells from healthy donors. An acute exercise bout increased NKT-like cell numbers in blood 2-fold. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that exercise mobilized NKT-like cells have an upregulation of genes and transcriptomic programs associated with enhanced anti-tumor activity__ including cytotoxicity__ cytokine responsiveness__ and migration. Exercise__ however__ did not augment the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells or alter their surface phenotypes after 21-days of culture. CIK cells expanded at rest__ during exercise (at 60% and 80% VO2max) or after (1h post) were equally capable of killing leukemia__ lymphoma__ and multiple myeloma target cells with and without cytokine (IL-2) and antibody (OKT3) priming in vitro. We conclude that acute exercise in healthy donors mobilizes NKT-like cells with an upregulation of transcriptomic programs involved in anti-tumor activity__ but does not augment the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells.,GSE212740,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/12
Efficacy-enhanced anti-CD7 universal chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory CD7-positive hematological malignancies: A phase I clinical study,Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy in T cell malignancies faces fratricide__ T cell aplasia__ and product contamination. We developed an universal anti-CD7 CAR-T cells in which TRAC__ CD7 and HLA-II were disrupted__ while E-cadherin (a NK cell inhibitory molecule) was introduced__ to mitigate graft versus host disease (GvHD)__ fratricide and rejection. Furthermore__ we designed a subtle receptor__ bbzg-CAR__ comprising not only conventional domains (anti-CD7 scFv__ 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain__ and CD3ζ signaling domain)__ but also the intracellular domain of common γ chain. Bbzg-CAR-T exerted anti-tumor effects superior to those of conventional universal CAR-T cells. In adoptive therapy for relapsed/refractory (r/r) patients__ no dose-limiting toxicity__ GvHD__ immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity or severe cytokine release syndrome (grade≥3) was observed. Nine patients (82%) showed objective response with__ complete response rates of 75% and 33.3% in r/r leukemia and lymphoma respectively. Preliminary safety and efficacy of this universal CAR-T product was achieved in CD7+ malignancies.,GSE192453,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/08
SECANT: a biology-guided semi-supervised method for clustering__ classification__ and annotation of single-cell multi-omics,The recent advance of single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology such as Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) allows researchers to quantify cell surface protein abundance and RNA expression simultaneously at single cell resolution. Although CITE-seq and other similar technologies have quickly gained enormous popularity__ novel methods for analyzing this new type of single cell multi-omics data are still in urgent need. A limited number of available tools utilize data-driven approach__ which may undermine the biological importance of surface protein data. In this study__ we developed SECANT__ a biology-guided SEmi-supervised method for Clustering__ classification__ and ANnoTation of single-cell multi-omics. SECANT can be used to analyze CITE-seq data__ or jointly analyze CITE-seq and scRNA-seq data. The novelties of SECANT include 1) using confident cell type labels identified from surface protein data as guidance for cell clustering__ 2) providing general annotation of confident cell types for each cell cluster__ 3) fully utilizing cells with uncertain or missing cell type labels to increase performance__ and 4) accurate prediction of confident cell types identified from surface protein data for scRNA-seq data. Besides__ as a model-based approach__ SECANT can quantify the uncertainty of the results__ and our framework can be easily extended to handle other types of multi-omics data. We successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of SECANT via simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real datasets. We believe this new method will greatly help researchers characterize novel cell types and make new biological discoveries using single cell multi-omics data.,GSE168264,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/09/03
Single Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of MCL Patient Samples,Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare__ highly heterogeneous type of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) driven by multiple genetic mutations disrupting cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. Despite advances in therapy__ novel treatment approaches are needed especially for highly proliferative MCL which has a particularly progressive clinical course even in the era of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase therapy. The sumoylation pathway is known to be upregulated in many cancers including lymphoid malignancies. However__ little is currently known about the role of the sumoylation pathway and its oncogenic potential in MCL. We found extensive upregulation of the sumoylation pathway in MCL__ particularly at the level of the E1 enzymes SAE1 and SAE2__ with elevated expression levels of sumoylation enzyme components showing a worse prognosis and a strong positive correlation with cell cycle associated genes. Targeting the sumoylation pathway with TAK-981__ a first in class sumoylation inhibitor currently being investigated in a clinical study of B-cell NHL in combination with rituximab (NCT04074330)__ resulted in potent loss of sumoylation in MCL cells with significant activity in in-vitro and in vivo models of MCL__ including ibrutinib resistance cases. We found mitotic dysregulation to be an important__ although not all encompassing mechanism of cell death upon loss of sumoylation of TAK-981 in MCL cells. We uncovered a diverse sumoylation program upon mitosis entry that was significantly reduced with TAK-981. Centromeric localization of the well known sumoylation substrate topoisomeraseIIA (TopIIA) was significantly abrogated upon mitosis entry__ likely contributing at least in part to the mitotic dysregulation seen in MCL cells. This mechanism is highly relevant as TopIIA is significantly upregulated in MCL with SAE1/2 overexpression. Our study__ in addition to the recently described immunomodulatory activity of TAK-981__ not only validates SAE1/2 as a therapeutic target in MCL but also opens the door to further mechanistic work to uncover how to best use desumoylation therapy to treat MCL and other lymphoid malignancies.,GSE184031,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/02
Immune challenged SC-islets first response profiled by single cell transcription analysis after co-culture with human allogeneic PBMCs [scRNA-seq_invitro],We performed an in vitro co-culture of allogeneic PBMCs and SC-islet clusters. SC-islet clusters were enriched for β cells (using CD49A magnetic sorting; SC-α still remain at lower numbers) (Veres et al.__ 2019)__ dissociated and reaggregated to obtain a more uniform cell count between wells. SC-islets were co-cultured with human allogeneic PBMCs for 24 or 48 hours. As controls [time(t)=0]__ SC-islets remained in culture without PBMC addition. These samples__ in addition to PBMCs alone (t=0)__ were used for scRNA-seq (Figure 2A).,GSE200084,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/01
Single cell transcriptional profile of SC-islet grafts in an in vivo humanized model [scRNA-seq_invivo],To study immune responses in the context of human allogeneic graft rejection__ we chose the Hu-PBL-NSG-MHCnull humanized mouse (Brehm et al.__ 2019). NOD-scid IL-2 receptor subunit γ (IL2rg)null (NSG) immunocompromised mice that lack murine MHC class I and II__ were transplanted (under the kidney capsule__ n=12) with 5M SC-islets (HLA-A2 positive)__ followed by human PBMC injection (termed ‘hPi-mice’; 50M/mouse__ n=6) from healthy unmatched donors (HLA-A2 negative). The lack of murine MHC allowed us to monitor the graft function for prolonged durations without the risk of xenogeneic graft vs host disease (GVHD). Half of the SC-islet transplanted cohort (n=6 mice) was used as the control__ without PBMC injection (Figure 1A). Since graft elimination by PBMCs is incomplete and residual endocrine cells remain in the hPi-mice grafts__ we retrieved the SC-islet grafts for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. These samples__ along with pre-injected PBMCs as controls__ were used for 10x Genomics mRNA expression library preparation and Illumina sequencing.,GSE200083,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/09/01
Adolescent bone sarcomas have distinct immune signatures and intercellular communication networks,Ewing and osteosarcoma are bone sarcomas that occur predominantly in adolescents. In the setting of metastatic or recurrent disease__ overall prognosis is poor. While immunotherapy is effective for some adult soft tissue sarcoma__ limited success has been achieved with immunotherapy for pediatric bone sarcomas. To better understand antitumor immunity in Ewing and osteosarcoma patients__ we performed single-cell RNAseq on peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating immune populations using 10X Genomics droplet-based approach. We also included peripheral blood from healthy adolescent blood donors as a comparator. Utilizing these transcriptional profiles__ we characterized tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells and myeloid cells and identified intercellular communication networks in both primary and recurrent disease.,GSE198896,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/08/31
Single-cell atlas of diverse immune populations in the advanced biliary tract cancer microenvironment,Immunotherapies have been explored in treating solid tumors__ albeit with disparate clinical effects in distinct cancer types. Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC)__ we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples. We identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45__851 cells__ in which exhausted CD8+ T cells__ macrophages__ and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME__ and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1__ indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1__ TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD__ HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1α-XBP1 (4μ8C)__ the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group. Collectively__ comprehensive transcriptome profiling provides deeper insights into the immune atlas in advanced BTC__ which might be instrumental in exploring novel immunotherapy strategies.,GSE201425,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/08/26
The immunogenicity of human kidney organoids,Safety issues of human iPSC-derived kidney organoids as a regenerative therapy need to be evaluated. Therefore__ we studied the immunogenicity of human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We subcutaneously implanted kidney organoids in immune-deficient IL2Ry-/-RAG2-/- mice for 1 month and hereafter performed adoptive transfer of healthy allogeneic human PBMC. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the diversity of kidney organoid cells and immune cell profiles. We investigated whether innate and adaptive immune cells invade kidney organoids__ evoke an immune response__ and influence the kidney organoid differentiation and functional capacity. Understanding the immunogenicity of kidney organoids will advance studies in the applicability of kidney organoids for regenerative medicine.

Fate-resolved gene regulatory signatures of individual B lymphocytes in the early stages of Epstein-Barr Virus infection,Enriched human B lymphocyte sample were collected at key timepoints before and after infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and analyzed to evaluate cellular heterogeneity with respect to gene expression and chromatin accessibility using single-cell multiomics library construction__ sequencing__ and analysis. These data were used to construct a multi-state model of post-infection dynamics and distinct B cell fate trajectories that arise from different cellular responses induced by EBV. These responses include antiviral interferon response induction__ DNA damage responses and growth arrest__ oncogene-induced senescence__ B cell activation__ and activation-induced differentiation into plasmablasts.,GSE189141,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/08/24
Circulating monocytes associated with anti-PD-1 resistance in human biliary cancer induce T cell paralysis [bulkRNA-seq],Suppressive myeloid cells can contribute to immunotherapy resistance__ but their role in response to checkpoint inhibition (CPI) in anti-PD-1 refractory cancers__ such as biliary tract cancer (BTC)__ is largely unknown. We use multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic and epitope sequencing to profile greater than 200__000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from advanced BTC patients (n=9) and matched healthy donors (n=8). Following anti-PD-1 treatment__ CD14+ monocytes expressing high levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemotactic molecules (CD14CTX) increase in the circulation of patients with BTC tumors that are CPI-resistant. CD14CTX can directly suppress CD4+ T cells and induce SOCS3 expression in CD4+ T cells rendering them functionally unresponsive. The CD14CTX gene signature associates with worse survival in patients with BTC as well as in other anti-PD-1 refractory cancers. These results demonstrate that monocytes arising after anti-PD-1 treatment can induce T cell paralysis as a distinct mode of tumor-mediated immunosuppression leading to CPI resistance. ,GSE211627,Homo sapiens,Other,2022/08/23
Single‑cell analysis of peripheral CD8+ T cell responses in patients receiving checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for cancer,Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has become a first-line treatment option for cancer patients__ with success in increasingly diverse cancer types. Still__ many patients do not experience durable responses and the reasons for clinical success versus failure remain largely undefined. Investigation of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment can be highly informative but access to tumor tissue is not always available__ highlighting the need to identify biomarkers in the blood that correlate with clinical success. Here__ we used single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor sequencing to define CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood of two patients with melanoma before and after immunotherapy with either anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) alone or the combination of anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab). Both treatment regimens increased transcripts associated with cytolytic effector function and decreased transcripts associated with naive T cells. These responses were further evaluated at the protein level and extended to a total of 53 patients with various cancer types. Unexpectedly__ the induction of CD8+ T cell responses associated with cytolytic function was variable and did not predict therapeutic success in this larger patient cohort. Rather__ a decrease in the frequency of T cells with a naive-like phenotype was consistently observed after immunotherapy and correlated with prolonged patient survival. In contrast__ a more detailed clonotypic analysis of emerging and expanding CD8+ T cells in the blood revealed that a majority of individual T cell clones responding to immunotherapy acquired a transcriptional profile consistent with cytolytic effector function. These results suggest that responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy are evident and traceable in patients’ blood__ with outcomes predicted by the simultaneous loss of naive-like CD8+ T cells and the expansion of mostly rare and diverse cytotoxic CD8+ T cell clones.,GSE211504,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/08/23
Integrated multiomics profiling identifies the differentiation program of regulatory T cells in human tumors [bulk RNA-seq],Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress effective antitumor immunity in tumor-bearing hosts__ thereby becoming promising targets in cancer immunotherapy. Here__ we show that Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human lung cancers harbor a completely different open chromatin profile compared to effector T cells and peripheral Treg cells. The integrative sequencing analyses revealed that BATF__ IRF4__ NF-κb__ and NR4A were important transcription factors for Treg cell differentiation in the TME. Particularly__ BATF was identified as a key regulator__ which leveraged Treg cell differentiation through epigenetically controlling activation-associated gene expression__ resulting in the robustness of Treg cells in the TME. BATF deficiency in Treg cells remarkably inhibited tumor growth and high BATF expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer__ kidney cancer__ and melanoma. Our results propose the specific chromatin remodeling and differentiation program of Treg cells in the TME__ which can be applied in the development of Treg cell-targeted therapies.,GSE211044,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/08/22

IL-4-induced quiescence of resting naïve B cells is disrupted in systemic lupus erythematosus,Activated naïve (aNAV) B cells have been shown to be the precursor of the CD11c+T-bet+ IgD−CD27− double negative (DN)2 or atypical memory (aMEM) B cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To determine factors that maintain resting naïve (rNAV) B cells__ the transcriptomics program in naïve (IGHD+IGHM+) B cells in human healthy controls (HC) and SLE was analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing analysis. In HC__ naive B cells expressed IL-4 pathway genes whereas in SLE__ naive B cells expressed type I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In HC__ aNAV B cells exhibited upregulation of gene signature of germinal center (GC) and classical memory (cMEM) B cells. In contrast__ in SLE__ aNAV B cells expressed signature genes of aMEM. In vitro exposure of SLE B cells to IL-4 promoted B cell development into CD27+CD38+ plasmablasts/plasma and IgD−CD27+ cMEM B cells. The same treatment blocked the development of CD11c+Tbet+ aNAV and DN2 B cells and preserved DN B cells as CD11c−Tbet− DN1 B cells. Lower expression of IL-4R and increased intracellular IFN-β in naïve B cells was correlated with the accumulation of CD21−IgD− B cells and the development of anti-Smith and anti-DNA autoantibodies in SLE patients (n=47). Our results show that IL-4R and type I IFN signaling in naïve B cells induce the development of distinct lineages of cMEM versus aMEM B cells__ respectively. Further__ a diminished IL-4R signaling shifted activated B-cell development from the DN1 to the DN2 trajectory in SLE patients. Therapies that enhance IL-4R signaling may be beneficial for ISGhi SLE.,GSE136035,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/08/12

Elevated Myl9 reflects the Myl9-containing microthrombi in SARS-CoV-2-induced exudative vasculitis and predicts COVID-19 severity,The mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is strongly correlated with pulmonary vascular pathology accompanied by SARS-CoV-2 infection-triggered immune dysregulation and aberrant activation of platelets. We combined histological analyses using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses of the lungs from autopsy samples and single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate the pathogenesis of vasculitis and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. We found that SARS-CoV-2 accumulated in the pulmonary vessels__ causing exudative vasculitis accompanied by the emergence of thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1)-expressing non-canonical monocytes and the formation of Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9)-containing microthrombi in the lung of COVID-19 patients with fatal disease. The amount of plasma Myl9 in COVID-19 was correlated with the clinical severity and measuring plasma Myl9 together with other markers allowed us to predict the severity of the disease more accurately. This study provides detailed insight into the pathogenesis of vasculitis and immunothrombosis__ which may lead to optimal medical treatment for COVID-19.,GSE208337,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/07/21
Tissue-resident Memory and Circulating T cells are Early Responders to Pre-surgical Cancer Immunotherapy,Pre-surgical (neoadjuvant) immune checkpoint blockade has shown promising activity in multiple cancer types__ but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here__ we characterized early kinetic changes in tumor-infiltrating and circulating immune cells in oral cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 in a phase 2 clinical trial. Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells that clonally expanded during immunotherapy expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs compared to non-responding cells. These programs were already active in pre-treatment T cells that later responded__ reflecting a capacity for rapid response. Treatment also induced a systemic immune response__ including expansion of pre-existing and emergent T cell clonotypes undetectable prior to therapy. The frequency of activated blood CD8 T cells__ including pretreatment PD-1-positive KLRG1-negative T cells__ was strongly associated with intra-tumoral pathological response__ and these activated cells were enriched for tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes. These results demonstrate how neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade induces local and systemic tumor immunity.,GSE200996,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/07/07
Single cell profiling of γδ hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma unravels tumor cell heterogeneity associated with disease progression,Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare but very aggressive lymphoma mostly derived from γδ T cells. The molecular pathogenesis driving HSTCL is largely unknown while only limited treatment options are available with poor outcomes. In this study__ we performed paired single cell RNA-seq and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on biopsies collected from a HSTCL patient pre- and post- chemotherapy treatments. We characterized unique gene expressing signatures of malignant γδ T cells with a set of marker genes were newly identified in HSTCL (AREG__ PLEKHA5__ VCAM1 etc.). Although the malignant cells were expanded from a single TCR clonotype according to their TCR sequences__ they evolved into two transcriptional distinct tumor subtypes during the disease progression. The Tumor_1 subtype was dominant in pre-treatment samples with highly aggressive phenotypes. The Tumor_2 had relative mild cancer hallmark signatures but expressed genes associated with survival and drug resistance (IL32__ TOX2__ AIF1__ AKAP12 etc.)__ and finally became the major tumor subtype post-treatment. We further dissected the tumor microenvironment of the HSTCL and found CD8 memory T cells were clonal expanded post-treatment. In addition__ we discovered dynamically rewiring cell-cell interaction networks during the treatment. The tumor cells had reduced interactions with the microenvironment post-treatment. Our study reveals heterogenous and dynamic tumor and microenvironment underlying pathogenesis of HSTCL and may contribute to identify novel targets for diagnosis and cure of HSTCL in the future.,GSE193220,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/07/01
Identification of Pathogenic Immune Cell Subsets in Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Myocarditis,Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies used widely to activate the immune system against tumor cells. Despite their therapeutic benefits__ ICIs are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAE) such as myocarditis__ a rare but serious side effect with up to 50% mortality. To identify pathogenic immune subset(s) responsible for ICI myocarditis and other irAE__ we performed single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 40 patients and controls with irAE including four patients with ICI myocarditis. We also profiled 15 patients/controls using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with feature barcoding for surface marker expression confirmation. In both CyTOF/scRNAseq analyses__ we found expansions of cytotoxic CD8+ T effector cells re-expressing CD45RA (Temra CD8+ cells) in ICI myocarditis patients compared to controls. Using T cell receptor sequencing__ we demonstrated a significant clonal expansion of CD8+ Temra cells in myocarditis patients. Transcriptomic profiling of these Temra CD8+ clones confirmed their highly activated and cytotoxic phenotype with expression of granzyme/perforin. Longitudinal data revealed the progression of these Temra CD8+ cells into an exhausted phenotype two months after diagnosis of myocarditis and after treatment with glucocorticoids. Differential expression of several proinflammatory chemokines (CCL4/CCL4L2/CCL5) was uncovered in the clonally expanded Temra CD8+ cells and ligand-receptor analysis implicated their regulation of other inflammatory cells such as monocytes and NK cells. These data suggest that the therapeutic modulation of these chemokines may serve as an attractive strategy for reducing life-threatening irAE in ICI-treated cancer patients.,GSE180045,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/06/29
Single Cell Analysis of CD8+ T-cells with Aging,CD8+ T cells play essential roles in combatting infection and cancers. The major subsets of CD8+ T cells such as naïve__ effector__ and memory carry out distinct functions. Although the defined subsets are known to be heterogeneous__ the precise composition of these subsets and their functional alterations have not been thoroughly determined. Here__ we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and multicolor immunophenotyping to analyze the composition of CD8+ T cells. From scRNAseq analysis of isolated CD8+ T cells from 16 healthy donors__ we analyzed 80__775 cells and identified a total of 13 subpopulations of CD8+ T cells including naïve__ central and effector memory cells and terminally differentiated effector memory cells (EMRA). In parallel__ our multi-color (16 antibody-panel) immunophenotyping analysis by flow cytometry of CD8+ T cells from 165 donors also divided CD8+ T cells into 11 major subpopulations. The majority of the subpopulations identified by these two methods were their age-related changes in percentage. Together__ our findings reveal previously unidentified subpopulations of CD8+ T cells__ their distinct transcriptional profiles and changes with age.,GSE136184,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/28
A pilot study of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors,Background: Preclinical work has demonstrated that ibrutinib inhibits the generation__ migration and immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). A pilot study tested the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Methods: Sixteen patients with metastatic solid malignancies were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg) daily and nivolumab (240 mg) IV on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycles. Ibrutinib dosing started 7 days before cycle 1 of nivolumab and was given until cycle 1__ day 8 of nivolumab. The effect of ibrutinib alone and in combination with nivolumab on circulating MDSC and immune subsets and cytokine/chemokine levels were measured. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing was also performed. Results: The most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (31%) and anorexia (31%). Five patients had a clinical response (4 partial__ 1 complete). Four patients had stable disease at 3 months. Median progression-free survival was 3.5 months and median overall survival 10.8 months. MDSC levels increased following 7 days of single-agent ibrutinib compared to baseline (21.91% vs. 27.67%). There was increased T cell proliferation in response (33.9% vs. 40.06%__ p<0.01) to the combination regimen. Plasma levels of CCL2__ CCL3__ CCL4__ CCL13__ IL- 8__ and VEGF-α decreased with ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib treatment altered the transcriptional state of the myeloid cell compartment and led to increased cancer-associated TCR clonotypes. Conclusion: The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab was well tolerated and ibrutinib significantly impacted MDSC and T cell function in patients with solid metastatic tumors.,GSE178882,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/06/24
Differential chromatin accessibility in peripheral blood mononuclear cells underlies COVID-19 disease severity prior to seroconversion [scATAC-Seq],SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers profound and variable immune responses in human hosts. Chromatin remodeling has been observed in individuals severely ill or convalescing with COVID-19__ but chromatin remodeling early in disease prior to anti-spike protein IgG seroconversion has not been defined. We performed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from outpatients with mild or moderate symptom severity at different stages of clinical illness. Early in the disease course prior to IgG seroconversion__ modifications in chromatin accessibility associated with mild or moderate symptoms were already robust and included severity-associated changes in accessibility of genes in interleukin signaling__ regulation of cell differentiation and cell morphology. Furthermore__ single-cell analyses revealed evolution of the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcription factor motif accessibility for individual PBMC cell types over time. The most extensive remodeling occurred in CD14+ monocytes__ where sub-populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were observed prior to seroconversion. Mild symptom severity was marked by upregulation classical antiviral pathways__ including those regulating IRF1 and IRF7__ whereas in moderate disease__ these classical antiviral signals diminished__ suggesting dysregulated and less effective responses. Together__ these observations offer novel insight into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of diagnostic tools for COVID-19.,GSE206455,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/23
Checkpoint Inhibitors Modulate Plasticity of Innate Lymphoid Cells in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Introduction: The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in cancer and specifically in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been approved for treatment of patients with HCC. The effect of ICI on ILCs has not been explored. Methods: We studied ILCs in PBMCs of 51 patients with HCC at baseline and after treatment with ICI. Flow cytometry was used to study ILC composition. Single-cell RNA-sequencing using a targeted panel of 405 immune-related genes was used to characterize the transcriptomic profiles as well as cellular trajectory of ILCs before and after ICI therapy. Intracellular cytokine staining was used to validate ILC function. Data from large patient cohorts were used to predict association with survival. Results: Characterization of the ILC subgroups in PBMCs of HCC patients revealed a significant increase in ILC1 and a decrease in ILC3 frequencies. Single cell RNA-sequencing identified a subgroup of NK-like ILCs which expressed cytotoxicity markers as well as NKp80/KLRF1. This KLRF1high-NK-like population showed low abundance in patients with HCC and was enhanced after combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Trajectory analysis placed this population in between ILC1 and ILC3s. The transcriptomic signature of KLRF1high NK-like ILCs was associated with better progression-free survival in HCC cohorts. Conclusions: We present a previously unknown effect of HCC tumors and ICIs on the composition and plasticity of ILCs in PBMCs. We identified a cytotoxic KLRF1high-NK-like subgroup which was associated with better survival__ absent in untreated HCC patients__ and enhanced upon ICI immunotherapy. Thus__ ILCs from PBMC can be used to study changes in the innate immune system under immunotherapy.,GSE195648,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/23

With current therapies__ more than 90% of CHD patients survive into adulthood but often suffer premature death from heart failure (HF) and non-cardiac causes 1. To gain insight into poorly understood disease progression__ we performed single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and analyzed more than 157__000 nuclei from donors and CHD patients__ including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)__ two common forms of cyanotic CHD lesions__ as well as__ dilated (DCM) and hypertrophic (HCM) cardiomyopathies. We observed CHD specific cell states in cardiomyocytes (CMs) which had evidence of insulin resistance and increased FOXO and CRIM1 expression. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in HLHS had enrichment for a low HIPPO and high YAP cell state characteristic of activated CFs. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) uncovered the spatially resolved perivascular microenvironment consistent with an immunodeficient state in CHD. Peripheral immune cell profiling suggested deficient monocytic immunity in CHD in agreement with CHD predilection to infection and cancer 2.

Mild symptom severity was marked by upregulation classical antiviral pathways__ including those regulating IRF1 and IRF7__ whereas in moderate disease__ these classical antiviral signals diminished__ suggesting dysregulated and less effective responses. Together__ these observations offer novel insight into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of diagnostic tools for COVID-19.,GSE206263,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/19
Detection of Cell-Cell Interactions via Photocatalytic Cell Tagging,The growing appreciation of immune cell-cell interactions within disease environments has led to significant efforts to develop highly effective protein-__ and cell-based immunotherapies.  However__ characterizing these complex cell-cell interactions in high resolution remains challenging.  Thus__ technologies that leverage therapeutic-based modalities for profiling intercellular environments can provide unique advantages towards understanding these cellular interactions at molecular-level detail.  To address this__ we introduce photocatalytic cell tagging (PhoTag)__ a platform for profiling cell-cell interactions that utilizes a single domain antibody (VHH) conjugated to a photoactivatable flavin-based cofactor.  Upon irradiation with visible light__ the tethered flavin photocatalyst generates phenoxy radical tags for targeted labeling within cell-cell contact environments.  Using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 VHH flavin conjugates__ we demonstrate that PhoTag achieves highly selective synaptic labeling in antigen presenting cell-T cell co-culture systems. By combining the high resolution transcellular biotinylation capability of PhoTag with multi-omics single cell sequencing__ we interrogated transient interactions between Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and Raji PD-L1 B cells and discovered that specific T cell subtypes can transiently interact more efficiently than others.   We envision that the spatio-temporal and modular nature of PhoTag will enable its broad utilization for detailed profiling of intercellular interactions across different biological systems. ,GSE206140,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/06/18

Immune responses to Coronavirus disease-19 with Thymosin α 1 intervention: an observational cohort study,Background Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to global health. Thymosin α 1 (Tα1) was considered being applied in COVID-19 therapy. However__ there were limited clinical evidence to support. We aimed to study the immune and inflammation response to COVID-19 under Tα1 treatment and confirm its clinical benefit. Methods We did a cohort study including COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers with or without Tα1 treatment. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples. Single cell RNA-sequencing (ScRNA-seq) and T cell receptor-sequencing (TCR-seq) was done to test for immune responses. Findings The proportion of CD3+KLRD1+ NKT__ TBX21+CD8+ NKT was significant higher in Health controls with Tα1 treatment (HCT) than those without Tα1 (HC) (p=0.016; p=0.031). The proportion of CD3+KLRD1+ NKT__ TBX21+CD8+ NKT was also observed increase in COVID-19 patients with Tα1 treatment (COVT) than those without Tα1 (COV) (p=0.024; p=0.010). The proportion of CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+ classical monocyte was significant lower in COVT in comparison with COV. Those cell sets were significantly associated with thymosin intervention (CD3+KLRD1+ NKT__ p=0.028; TBX21+CD8+ NKT__ p=0.003; CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+ classical monocyte__ p=0.047). Interpretation The increased T cell and decreased monocyte response might support the prevention and therapy effect of Tα1 treatment. These data might also serve as a rich resource for designing cellular immunity therapies for this pandemic disease.,GSE169441,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/08
Distinct gene expression by expanded clones of quiescent memory CD4+ T cells harboring intact latent HIV-1 proviruses,Antiretroviral therapy controls but does not cure HIV-1 infection due to a reservoir of rare CD4 + T cells harboring latent proviruses. Little is known about the transcriptional program of latent cells. Here we report a novel strategy to enrich clones of latent cells carrying intact__ replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses from blood based on their expression of unique T cell receptors. Latent cell enrichment enabled single cell transcriptomic analysis of 1__050 CD4 + T cells belonging to expanded clones harboring intact HIV-1 proviruses from 6 different individuals. The analysis revealed that most of these cells are T effector memory cells that are enriched for expression of HLA-DR__ HLA-DP__ CD74__ CCL5__ Granzymes A and K__ cystatin F__ LYAR and DUSP2. We conclude that expanded clones of latent cells carrying intact HIV-1 proviruses persist preferentially in a distinct CD4 + T cell population opening new possibilities for eradication.,GSE204756,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/06/03
Analysis of metabolic characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with leukemia at the single cell level,We collected peripheral blood from leukemia patients at different stages__ including those newly diagnosed as untreated__ as well as those in remission on therapy__ with a subset of samples including peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. First__ mononuclear cells were isolated from the collected peripheral blood__ followed by single-cell RNA sequencing and follow-up sequencing results for subgroup classification__ focusing on changes such as glycolipid metabolism of B cells as well as T cells. The aim of this project was to explore the changes in metabolic remodeling in leukemia patients with the aid of single-cell technology to provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.,GSE205219,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/06/02
Single-cell RNA sequencing unveils the clonal and transcriptional landscape of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas,Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma__ arising from clonal expansion of transformed skin-homing memory T cells. However__ the lack of specific markers for malignant lymphocytes prevents distinguishing them from benign T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of MF__ thus delaying diagnosis and development of specific treatment__ which results in poor clinical outcomes. Here we employed recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish the transcriptome of expanded T-cell clones directly in advanced-stage MF skin tumors__ allowing the transcriptional profiles of malignant and reactive T lymphocytes to be distinguished. Our analysis identified multiple non-overlapping expanded T-cell clonotypes within individual MF tumors__ which included malignant and reactive clones. Heterogeneity among samples was observed not only in the number of expanded clonotypes but also in their TCR specificity and gene expression. While patient-specific tumorigenic pathways were up-regulated by the malignant clones__ we also identified a common gene expression that included genes associated with cancer cell metabolism__ de novo nucleotide biosynthesis__ and invasion. Most non-malignant clones originated from CD8+ T cells and commonly presented an exhausted immune phenotype and activated Th1/Th2 pathways. While non-clonal infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from all tumors shared anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways__ patient-specific mechanisms included the TNFR2 signaling cascade__ ferroptosis__ and cytotoxic pathways by gamma/delta T cells. Thus__ scRNAseq reveals new insights in MF pathogenesis by providing an unprecedented report of the transcriptomes of malignant and reactive T cells in the TME of individual patients and offers novel prospective targets for personalized therapy.,GSE182861,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/06/01

Single cell RNA-seq by mostly-natural sequencing by synthesis,Massively parallel single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) for diverse applications__ from cell atlases to functional screens__ is increasingly limited by sequencing costs__ and large-scale low-cost sequencing can open many additional applications__ including patient diagnostics and drug screens. Here__ we adapted and systematically benchmarked a newly developed__ mostly-natural sequencing by synthesis method for scRNA-seq. We demonstrate successful application in four scRNA-seq case studies of different technical and biological types__ including 5’ and 3’ scRNA-seq__ human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single individual and in multiplex__ as well as Perturb-Seq. Our data show comparable results to existing technology__ including compatibility with state of the art scRNA-seq libraries independent of the sequencing technology used – thus providing an enhanced cost-effective path for large scale scRNA-seq.,GSE197452,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/05/31

Patients were selected based on their IFN-I response capacity (measured by mass cytometry)__ which is associated with patient survival after therapy. The purpose of the experiment was to better understand the mechanisms underlying the differences in outcome observed betwee the two patient groups.,GSE199994,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/30
Onepot-Seq: capturing single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous medium via transient localization of mRNA,The development of single-cell RNA-seq has broadened the spectrum for biological research by providing a high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity. However__ the requirement for sophisticated devices for the compartmentalization of cells has limited its widespread applicability. Here__ we develop Onepot-Seq__ a device-free__ well-based method__ that harnesses the transient localization of mRNA after lysis to capture single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous fluid medium. In mixed-species experiments__ we obtained high-quality single-cell profiles. Further__ cell-type-specific poly(A)-conjugated antibodies allow Onepot-Seq to effectively capture target cells in complex populations. Chemical perturbations to cells can be profiled by Onepot-Seq at single-cell resolution. Onepot-Seq should allow routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution__ accelerating clinical and scientific discoveries in many fields of science.,GSE204864,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/29
Gene expression profile at single cell level of two TDT patients' PBMCs after gene editing treatment.,BCL11A encodes for a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an important role in B-cell and pDC development. Although the +58 BCL11A enhancer we disrupted was reported as a erythroid specific enhancer__ we needed to further evaluate the potential down regulation of BCL11A in other subpopulations of edited PBMCs. To study the transcriptional impact of BCL11A enhancer gene editing__ we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on PBMCs.,GSE204688,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/29
Single Cell RNA-seq on Human PBMC,To assess the impact of IgG1 and IgG4 variants of a TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT fusion protein on human PBMC expression__ each fusion protein or an untreated control were incubated with human PBMC for 2 days in AIMV lymphoproliferative media. Both IgG1 and IgG4 variants of TIGIT-Fc-LIGHT induced broad immune cell activation on T__ NK__ and myeloid cells.,GSE201999,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/27
T helper 2-biased transcriptional profile predicts HIV envelope-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that correlated with reduced risk of infection in RV144 trial,Despite the critical role antigen-specific T cells play in containing viral infections__ their aggregate frequencies in peripheral blood have not correlated with clinical protection during HIV infection. However__ a subset of HIV-specific T cells__ which are capable of simultaneously producing multiple effector cytokines__ termed polyfunctional T cells__ have correlated with delayed disease progression. HIV-specific polyfunctional T cells have been enumerated and characterized using the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay__ which allows for simultaneous multiplexed analysis of cytokine expression at the single-cell level. In addition__ using an unbiased computational analysis of ICS data generated through the RV144 HIV vaccine case-control study__ we identified vaccine-induced HIV envelope (Env)-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells as a novel correlate of reduced risk of HIV infection. However__ very little is known about these cells and what differentiates them from other vaccine-elicited T cells. In addition__ the use of sample fixation in the ICS assay prevents those cells from being further interrogated for transcriptional differences. Thus__ we developed a novel live-cell multiplexed cytokine capture assay which allows for identification__ sorting and transcriptional profiling of individual antigen-specific polyfunctional T cells by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We applied these methods to peripheral blood samples from participants who had received the RV144 vaccine regimen as part of the HVTN 097 clinical trial. Using this approach__ we discovered transcriptional signatures that specifically identify the single-cell Env-specific CD4 T-cell functional profiles which had correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection in RV144. Interestingly__ this signature is particularly characterized by upregulation of Th2 cytokines__ supporting the hypothesis that the vaccine-induced Env-specific CD4 T cells likely contributed to the reduced risk of infection by providing T cell help to the Env-specific antibody responses. By interrogating the gene signatures that correlated with polyfunctionality__ we have identified potential mechanisms of how vaccine-elicited polyfunctional T cells may contribute to reduced risk of HIV infection.,GSE166945,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/25
Proximal tubule cells in blood and urine have potential as biomarkers for kidney disease biopsies,Early diagnosis and treatment is pivotal to the management of kidney disease__ whereas the pathological mechanisms and minimally invasive diagnostic method still need to be investigated. In the present study__ single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of kidney diseases in single cell level. Cellular gene expression profiles of cells of renal tissue__ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and urine from four nephritis patients were performed. Our analysis revealed 12 subsets of renal cells and leukocytes__ including fibroblast cells__ mesangial cells__ epithelial cells__ proximal tubule cells (PTCs)__ and 6 types of immune cells__ CD8+ T cell__ macrophages (MC)__ nature killer cells (NK)__ dendritic cells (DC)__ B cell and neutrophils. PTCs were detected in both PBMC and urine__ while PTC was negative in healthy blood sample. Multiple populations of fibroblast cells__ mesangial cells and PTCs demonstrated pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic responses. Gene expression analysis suggested that chemotactic and activating effect of inflammatory PTCs and fibroblasts on neutropils were critical for the development and progress of nephritis__ which was supported by the widely overexpressed pro-inflammatory genes in these cells. Gene expression profiles of inflammatory PTCs in PBMC__ urine and kidney are highly correlated__ indicating the high possibility of urine and PBMC PTCs in serving as a surrogate for kidney biopsies.,GSE203406,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/23
IL-33-activated calcitonin gene-related peptide-producing memory Th2 cells co-operate with somatosensory neurons to induce conjunctival itch,Allergic conjunctivitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by severe itch in the conjunctiva; but how neuro-immune interactions shape the pathogenesis of severe itch remains unclear. We identified a subset of memory-type pathogenic Th2 cells that preferentially expressed Il1rl1-encoding ST2 and Calca-encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the inflammatory conjunctiva using a single-cell analysis. The IL-33-ST2 axis in memory Th2 cells controlled the axonal elongation of the peripheral sensory C-fiber and the induction of severe itch. Pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of CGRP signaling in vivo attenuated scratching behavior. The analysis of giant papillae from patients with severe allergic conjunctivitis revealed ectopic lymphoid structure formation with the accumulation of IL-33-producing epithelial cells and CGRP-producing pathogenic CD4+ T cells accompanied by peripheral nerve elongation. Thus__ the IL-33-ST2-CGRP axis directs severe itch with neuro-reconstruction in the inflammatory conjunctiva and is a potential therapeutic target for severe itch in allergic conjunctivitis.,GSE203217,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/20
Single-Cell RNA Sequencing to Decipher the Immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases,Objectives: To investigate the differences in efficacy and safety between the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and mRNA-based vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna)__ and evaluate the impact of anti-rheumatic medications on immunogenicity in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD). Methods: From September 16 to November 15__ 2021__ we consecutively enrolled participants aged≥20 years with AIRD who received COVID-19 vaccination. The level of serum IgG antibodies to the SARS-Cov-2 receptor-binding domain on the spike protein S1 subunit was quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. The immunogenicity and adverse reactions between ChAdOx1 nCov-19/AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 were compared. Results: Of the 243 rheumatic disease patients who received COVID-19 vaccines__ 113 and 130 were immunized with AZD1222 and mRNA-1273__ respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate was 78.8% (89/113) for AZD1222 and 83.1% (108/130) for mRNA-1273. The level of anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG was higher in patients who received mRNA-1273 than in those who received AZD1222. Prednisolone-equivalent dose >5 mg/day__ methotrexate (MTX)__ non-anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a biologics__ and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor use were associated with inferior immunogenicity. All reported adverse reactions were minor. More localized pain at the injection site and less fever and chills were observed in patients receiving mRNA-1273 compared with those receiving AZD1222. Rheumatic disease activities after vaccination remained stable in most patients. Conclusions: mRNA-1273 and AZD1222 vaccines exhibited differential immunogenicity and adverse reaction profiles. Our study findings support temporary discontinuation of daily prednisolone dose >5 mg__ MTX__ non-anti-TNF-a biologics__ or JAK inhibitors after COVID-19 vaccination.,GSE203081,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/19
Single-cell RNA sequencing of right atrial blood mononuclear cells offers a novel approach to studying nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,We collected blood samples from the right atrium of newly diagnosed patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) for the first time__ and performed single-cell RNA sequencing of mononuclear cells. We then compared the profiles of cells from atrial blood with those of peripheral venous blood and found that a great difference in the gene expression profiles of T cells and B cells. We speculate that this difference is due to the pulmonary circulation and peripheral capillaries. We also analyzed the data of patients with EBV to provide data for the study of the relationship between EBV and NPC. This study also provides a unique single-cell sequencing dataset that will be a valuable resource in further elucidating the roles of mononuclear cells in NPC pathogenesis.,GSE202604,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/13
Marking the difference in acutely responding human CD8 T cells,The CD8 T cell response features functions that are fundamental for long-lasting immune protection__ including antigen-specific cytolysis and memory. Accordingly__ a range of differentiation subsets have been described with diverse functionalities and corresponding profiles of expression of markers. In both mouse and human systems__ a major distinction has been “memory” versus “effector” terms. On the one hand__ these terms may relate to temporality within the immune response : “effector” indicates the acute phase__ “memory” refers to the post-contraction__ resting phase. On the other hand__ the terms also assign prototypic differentiation phenotypes that may be found at the same time-point : memory or effector subsets__ based on characteristic markers. In this study__ we analyse the human CD8 T cell response to YF-17D vaccination as the best-known model of acute immune response in humans. We study 21 characteristic markers conventionally used in mice and in humans to analyse and describe differentiation__ activation__ cycling__ and so-called effector functions such as cytokine production and degranulation. We find clearly distinct ‘acute traits’ at the peak of the response that are shared amongst all non-naïve antigen-specific subsets__ including in memory phenotype cells. These acute traits were low BCL-2 and high Ki67__ CD38__ HLA- DR__ as well as increased Granzyme B and Perforin__ which have been previously attributed only to effector cells at the peak of the response. Altogether__ we evidenced ‘acute traits’ independent of differentiation phenotypes__ supporting the semantic and marker distinction between “effector” and “acute” terms in the human CD8 T cell response.,GSE148223,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/05/05

Single-cell assay examining chromatin accessibility reveals transcriptional regulatory variation in the proinflammatory milieu of uremia,A single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) was applied to compare the single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were obtained from healthy volunteers and uremia patients. Besides__ we further revealed the biological functions and regulatory modes of the uremia-related transcription factors (TFs). We principally identified 8 leukocytic clusters using promoter sums of cell type-specific marker genes. Representative TF motifs related to immune cell phenotype identification were found. The comparison of cells from uremia patients and healthy individuals revealed differential candidate TF motifs driving the uremia-associated transcriptomic signature changes__ thereby resulting in variation of multiple immune-inflammatory pathways__ virus infection-related pathways__ and tumor-associated pathways.Our findings reveal transcriptional regulatory variation in uremia-derived PBMCs from an epigenetic perspective__ providing a foundational framework for studies examining proinflammatory mechanisms in uremia and establishing a foundation for future research investigating epigenetic therapy.,GSE158280,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/27
Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs sampled from COVID-19 patients,To explore the underlying mechanism of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection in convalescent patients.

Biologic correlates of COVID-19 resolution using single cell RNA sequecing,We report a case of full resolution of severe COVID-19 due to convalescent plasma transfusion. Following transfusion__ the patient showed fever remission__ improved respiratory status__ and rapidly decreased viral burden in respiratory fluids and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Longitudinal single-cell transcriptomics of peripheral blood cells conducted prior to and at multiple times after convalescent plasma transfusion identified the key biological processes associated with the transition from severe disease to disease-free state. This included post-transfusion disappearance of a subset of monocytes characterized by hyperactivated Interferon responses and decreased TNF-α signaling.,GSE200896,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/18
A dynamic single cell-based framework for digital twins to prioritize disease genes and drug targets,A major health care problems today is that drug treatment is ineffective for many patients. This may depend on the involvement of thousands of genes__ which vary between patients with the same diagnosis at different time points. Identification and prioritization of upstream regulatory (UR) genes for precision medicine are therefore great challenges. In this study__ we present a framework to model dynamic cellulome- and genome-wide changes in digital twins__ to prioritize UR genes. We used seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model because the external trigger (pollen) is known__ so that the disease process can be mimicked by time series analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated PBMC from SAR patients. Based on single cell profiling data from different stages of the disease__ we constructed network models__ hypothesizing that the directed molecular interactions between cell types could be traced to find an UR cell type and gene. This hypothesis was rejected because the cellular interactions formed multi-directional networks__ rather than linear hierarchies. Instead__ we were successfully able to rank and prioritize the URs based on their relative effects on the different cell types. We propose that this ranking strategy is a scalable approach for organizing and analyzing cellulome- and genome-wide data in digital twins.,GSE180697,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/12
Endothelial-immune crosstalk contributes to vasculopathy in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,Cardiovascular complications are major causes of death in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but the underlying endothelial pathophysiology remains understudied. Here__ we cultivated blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that NAFLD BOECs were activated with chemokine hallmarks__ in particular__ enhanced CXCL12 was confirmed in arterial tissues of mouse NAFLD models. Immunoprofiling by single-cell analysis further uncovered T cell intensification and potentially T-helper type 1 inflammatory reactions in NAFLD. In evaluating CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in chemotaxis__ CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) substantially modulated the migration of CD4+ Tcells__ natural killer cells and monocytes towards NAFLD BOECs__ which was not observed in healthy control coculture. We found that NAFLD and healthy BOECs might preferentially recruit distinct subsets of immune cells__ as a result of unique chemokine ligand-receptor interactions. Finally__ we enumerated two folds more circulating endothelial cells__ a biomarker of vascular injury__ in NAFLD patients than healthy subjects. Our work provides insights for modulation of endothelial-immune crosstalk as an avenue for mitigating endothelial dysfunction in NAFLD. ,GSE179886,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/11
Single-cell eQTL mapping identifies cell type specific genetic control of autoimmune disease [scRNAseq_data],The human immune system displays remarkable variation between individuals__ leading to differences in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We present single cell RNA sequence data from 1__267__768 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types__ we identified 26__597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTL__ with the majority showing cell type specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells transitioning from na√Øve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to inter-individual variation in immune function. Finally__ utilizing a Mendelian randomization approach__ we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of inter-individual variation in the immune system.,GSE196735,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/08
Single-Cell immunoprofiling after immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis reveals functional suppression of pathogenic Th2 cells and clonal conversion,Background: Allergic rhinitis is a growing problem worldwide and the only treatment that modifies the cause of the disease is antigen-specific immunotherapy; however__ its mechanism(s) of action are not fully understood. Objective: Here__ we comprehensively investigated the role and changes of antigen-specific T cells before and after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP). Methods: We cultured PBMCs obtained both before and at one-year after initiating SLIT and used a combination of single-cell RNA sequence and repertoire sequencing. To investigate biomarkers__ we used PBMCs from patients participating a phase II/III trial of SLIT tablets for JCP and PBMCs from good and poor responders in outpatients. Results: Antigen-stimulated culturing after SLIT led to clonal expansion of Th2 and Treg cells__ and most of these CD4+ T cells retained their CDR3 regions before and after treatment__ indicating antigen-specific clonal responses and differentiation secondary to SLIT. However__ SLIT reduced the number of clonal functional Th2 cells but increased the Trans-type Th2 cell population that expresses musculin (MSC)__ TGF-β__ and IL-2. Trajectory analysis suggested that SLIT induced clonal differentiation of the Trans-type Th2 cells differentiated into Treg cells. By using real-time PCR__ we found that MSC levels increased after 1 year of treatment in the active SLIT group and good responders. Conclusion: The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire analysis helped reveal a part of the underlying mechanism— that SLIT promotes the expression of MSC on pathogenic Th2 cells and suppresses their function__ and that MSC may be a potential biomarker of SLIT for allergic rhinitis. Clinical implications MSC expression was higher in the group of active patients who were responsive to SLIT__ indicating that these molecules may be potential biomarkers of SLIT efficacy.,GSE200107,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/04/07
Amino acid transport represents a druggable process for inhibiting human plasmacytoid dendritic cell activity during autoimmunity,IL-3 mediates human plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) survival in vitro__ but its mechanism of action is unclear. We show that__ through JAK2/STAT5__ IL-3 and the related GM-CSF__ induce expression of System L amino acid transporters SLC7A5 and SLC3A2. This primes pDC to allow subsequent activation of mTORC1 in response to TLR9 stimulation. Active mTORC1 facilitates increased metabolic activity__ type I IFN and TNF production__ and the expression of SLC7A11__ a subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter__ xc—. We found that co-expression of SLC7A5__ SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 is a major transcriptional signature shared by cytokine-producing pDC in vitro__ and pDC at sites of autoimmune kidney damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Targeting the expression or function of these transporters with inhibitors of JAK2 and of xc— synergistically blocked cytokine production by pDC. We propose that such an approach may have value for treating SLE__ and other diseases in which pDC are implicated.,GSE157305,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/04/07

Single-cell RNA sequencing of metastatic testicular seminoma reveals the cellular and molecular characteristics of metastatic cell lineage,Testicular cancer is the most common solid malignancy in young men. Given the many histological classifications of testicular tumours__ seminoma is one of the most treatable cancers. The survival rate in early-stage disease was more than 90%. Thus__ seminoma at the cellular and molecular levels__ especially at the single-cell level__ is worth studying. We performed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) study on a patient who was diagnosed with testicular seminoma with lymph node metastasis. This study presented tumour tissue__ PBMC__ pelvic and renal hilus lymph node in a total of 18__206 high-quality single-cell transcriptome information. The characteristics of metastatic cell lineage were revealed by the comparison between different tumour cell subtypes at the scRNA level. A single-cell map of testicular seminoma with lymph node metastasis was constructed by scRNA-seq. We discovered the gene expression characteristics of the tumour cells in testicular seminoma__ especially metastatic tumour cells. KRT8 and KRT18 were commonly expressed in the three tumour cell subtypes. However__ TCF7L1__ SCG3 and SV2C were the specifically expressed genes of tumour cell subtypes in primary tumour sites. Some molecular markers specifically expressed by the metastatic cell lineage__ such as POU5F1__ were identified.

Single-cell multiomics of CD4+ T cell clones in HIV-1 infected individuals,The clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to cure. Using single-cell ECCITE-seq__ we examined the transcriptional landscape__ upstream immune regulators__ HIV-1 RNA expression__ and T cell clonal expansion dynamics of 215__458 CD4+ T cells (267 HIV-1 RNA+ cells and 68 expanded HIV-1 RNA+ T cell clones) from six HIV-1-infected individuals (during viremia and after suppressive antiretroviral therapy) and two uninfected individuals__ in unstimulated conditions and after CMV and HIV-1 antigen stimulation. We found that despite antiretroviral therapy__ antigen and TNF responses persisted and shaped T cell clonal expansion. HIV-1 resided in Th1 polarized__ antigen-responding T cells expressing Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic genes. HIV-1 RNA+ T cell clones were larger in clone size__ established during viremia__ persistent after viral suppression__ and enriched in GZMB+ cytotoxic effector memory Th1 cells. Targeting HIV-1-infected cytotoxic CD4+ T cells and drivers of clonal expansion provides a new direction for HIV-1 eradication.,GSE187515,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/03/21
mRNA expression profiling of PBMCs from Behcet’s disease,Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic vasculitis characterized by systemic immune aberrations. However__ a comprehensive understanding of the immune disturbances in BD and how they contribute to BD pathogenesis is lacking. Here__ we performed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated monocytes from BD patients and healthy controls. This dataset is the bulk RNA sequencing part (next generation sequencing-based genome-wide transcriptional profiling)__ which contains the transcriptional profilings of freshly isolated PBMCs from19 samples (10 healthy controls and 9 BD patients).,GSE198533,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/18
Enhanced cortical neural stem cell identity through short SMAD/WNT inhibition in human cerebral organoids facilitates emergence of outer radial glial cells.,Cerebral organoids exhibit broad regional heterogeneity accompanied by limited cortical cellular diversity under a variety of derivation methods__ suggesting inadequate patterning of early neural stem cell (NSC) starting populations. Here we show that a short combined Dual SMAD/WNT inhibition course during early organoid establishment is sufficient for yielding robust and lasting cortical identity with efficient suppression of non-cortical fates in organoid NSCs. In contrast__ other widely used methods are inconsistent in their cortical specification capacity. Furthermore__ combined inhibition selectively enriches for outer radial glia (oRG) cells in organoids that demarcate well-defined outer sub-ventricular (oSVZ)-like regions. Finally__ combined inhibition enables superior NSC radial organization__ further facilitates the generation of molecularly distinct deep and upper cortical layer neurons__ and uncovers cortex-specific microcephaly defects. Thus__ combined inhibition is critical for establishing a rich cortical cell repertoire__ for enabling fundamental cytoarchitectural features of cortical development__ and for meaningful disease modeling.,GSE189981,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/16
Single-cell transcriptomics highlights the proinflammatory contribution of C1q-high monocytes to Behçet’s disease,Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic vasculitis characterized by systemic immune aberrations. Here__ we performed single-cell sequencing to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated monocytes from BD patients and healthy donors. We observed prominent expansion and transcriptional changes in monocytes in PBMCs from BD patients. Deciphering the monocyte heterogeneity revealed the accumulation of C1q-high (C1qhi) monocytes in BD. Pseudotime inference indicated that BD monocytes markedly shifted their differentiation toward inflammation-accompanied and C1qhi monocyte-ended trajectory. Further experiments showed that C1qhi monocytes enhanced phagocytosis and proinflammatory cytokine secretion__ and multi-platform analyses revealed the significant clinical relevance of this subtype. Mechanistically__ C1qhi monocytes were induced by activated IFN-γ signaling in BD patients__ and were decreased by tofacitinib treatment. Our study illustrates BD immune landscape and the unrecognized contribution of C1qhi monocytes to BD hyperinflammation__ showing their potential as therapeutic targets and clinical assessment indexes.,GSE198616,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/15
Expansion__ persistence and efficacy of donor memory-like NK cells for the treatment of post-transplant relapse,Relapse of AML occurs in up to 50% of patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and heralds an extremely poor prognosis. Cytokine induced memory-like (CIML) human NK cells have enhanced ability to recognize and kill leukemia targets. We initiated a phase I trial of CIML NK cells to treat patients with relapsed myeloid malignancies after haplo-HCT (NCT04024761). Transcriptional profiling analysis by scRNAseq were used to characterize the immunophenotypes of infused NK cells post cell adoptive transfer and as well as their interactions with tumor cells.,GSE198141,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/11

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of blood T cells from healthy controls__ MS patients and COVID-19 patients by 10X genomics,In order to better understand the functional properties of this type of cells under different circumstances__ we integrated the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from healthy subjects__ MS patients and COVID-19 patients generated from the 10X Genomics platform using the Seurat package. KIR+CD8+ T cells from different conditions (healthy__ MS__ and COVID-19) formed a distinct cluster with high expression of effector genes (GZMB and PRF1) as well as KIR transcripts. These findings reveal the commonality of KIR+CD8+ T cells across physiological and diseased status as well as their uniqueness relative to other CD8+ T cells.,GSE193770,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/08
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of human KIR+ CD8 T cells by Smart-seq2,KIR+ CD8 T cells (Live CD3+CD56-TCRab+CD8+KIR+ cells) were sorted from the blood of healthy subjects (N=10) and patients with MS (N=2)__ SLE (N=6)__ or CeD (N=5) and subjected to single-cell RNA-seq analysis by Smart-seq2. In parallel__ we also analyzed their T-cell receptor (TCR) α and β sequences. Unsupervised clustering of these KIR+CD8+ T cells by Seurat identified six clusters__ with Clusters 1 to 3 mostly containing expanded KIR+CD8+ T cells (≥2 cells expressing same TCR) and Clusters 5 and 6 consisting of unexpanded cells expressing unique TCRs. There are common features shared by KIR+CD8+ T cells from healthy subjects and different diseases__ yet there is also heterogeneity (i.e.__ upregulated type I IFN signaling and glycolysis in Clusters 2 and 3) associated with different diseases or treatments.,GSE193439,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/03/08
RNA and surface epitope sequencing of single cells involved in spondyloarthritis,Early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PSA) and differentiation of this disease from similar but distinct arthritides__ such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS)__ is important for successful therapeutic intervention but currently remains challenging due__ in part__ to the scarcity of non-invasive biomarkers. In this study__ we perform single cell profiling of transcriptome and cell surface protein expression on the peripheral blood immunocyte populations of individuals with PSA__ individuals with AS__ individuals with cutaneous psoriasis (PSO) alone__ and healthy individuals to identify gene and protein features differentially expressed between these groups across 30 immune cell types and to further evaluate the diagnostic potential of these features using a machine learning classification approach.,GSE194315,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/03/07
Characterization of peripheral blood TCR in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus by BD Rhapsody™ VDJ CDR3 Assay,We used the latest technology__ BD Rhapsody__ to analyze the pairing of α and β chains that constitute the TCR of PBMCs from patients with type 1 diabetes at the single-cell level.,GSE197456,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/28
Single cell transcriptical changes in major trauma patient,The mortality rate for patients with trauma is 5.8 million per year. For people aged 15-49__ trauma is one of the three leading causes of death. Activation of the coagulation system__ intractable hypoxemia__ infections and acidosis accompanying post-traumatic patients cannot be separated from trauma immunization. The purpose of this research is to understand the expression of immune cells in patients after trauma__ especially severe multiple injuries__ and to construct an immune cell profile of patients with multiple injuries.,GSE197522,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/26
Characterizing cellular heterogeneity in chromatin state with scCUT&Tag-pro,New technologies that profile chromatin modifications at single-cell resolution offer enormous promise for functional genomic characterization. However__ the sparsity of these measurements and the challenge of integrating multiple binding maps represent significant challenges. Here we introduce scCUT&Tag-pro__ a multimodal assay for profiling protein-DNA interactions coupled with the abundance of surface proteins in single cells. In addition__ we introduce scChromHMM__ which integrates data from multiple experiments to infer and annotate chromatin states based on combinatorial histone modification patterns. We apply these tools to perform an integrated analysis across nine different molecular modalities in circulating human immune cells. We demonstrate how these two approaches can characterize dynamic changes in the function of individual genomic elements across both discrete cell states and continuous developmental trajectories__ nominate associated motifs and regulators that establish chromatin states__ and identify extensive and cell type-specific regulatory priming. Finally__ we demonstrate how our integrated reference can serve as a scaffold to map and improve the interpretation of additional scCUT&Tag datasets.,GSE195725,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/24
Tumor infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells dictate divergent survival outcomes in pre- versus post-menopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)__ yet have no association with survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC. The basis for these contrasting findings remains elusive. We identify subsets of BC tumors infiltrated by CD8+ T cells with characteristic features of exhausted T cells (TEX). Tumors with abundant CD8+ TEX exhibit a distinct tumor microenvironment marked by amplified interferon-γ signaling related pathways and higher PD-L1 expression. Paradoxically__ high levels of CD8+ TEX TILs associate with decreased overall survival ER+ BC patients__ but not TNBC patients. Moreover__ high tumor expression of a CD8+ TEX signature identifies dramatically reduced survival in pre-menopausal__ but not post-menopausal__ ER+ BC patients. Finally__ we demonstrate the value of a tumor TEX signature score in identifying high-risk pre-menopausal ER+ BC patients amongst those with intermediate Oncotype Dx breast recurrence scores. Our data highlight the complex relationship between CD8+ TILs__ interferon-γ signaling__ and estrogen receptor status in BC patient survival. This work identifies pre-menopausal ER+ BC patients with high levels of tumor infiltrating CD8+ TEX as a high-risk subset that may benefit from immunotherapy strategies.,GSE190202,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/23
Therapeutic modulation of NKG7 in CD8+ T cells increases anti-tumor cytotoxicity and improves response to immune checkpoint inhibitors,Monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory signaling have been successfully used to treat a variety of solid tumor malignancies__ but only a subset of patients benefit from this treatment. It remains unclear why the majority of patients fail to respond and what other limiting factors are at play. Here we show that natural killer cell granule protein-7 (NKG7) is critical for the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells and response to anti-PD-1 therapy. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of peripheral CD8+ T cells from patients treated with anti-PD-1 and found that NKG7 gene expression was decreased in the non-responding patients.,GSE164237,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/02/18
Identification of distinct immune cell subsets associated with various clinical presentations__ disease severity and viral persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,The clinical presentations and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable__ ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe conditions__ and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study__ we performed the single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the healthy controls (HC)__ asymptomatic individuals (AS) and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (SM) with various clinical features and disease severity. We first identified nine major cell types__ including T cells__ B cells__ monocytes__ natural killer (NK) cells__ dendritic cells (DC)__ platelets__ neutrophils__ plasma cells and stem cells from a total of 119__799 single cells captured and filtered for the final analysis__ and then divided these cell types into separate cell clusters and sub-clusters__ respectively. We revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in profound alternations in various cellular compartments and identified a number of distinct immune cell subsets that were associated with various clinical presentations__ disease severity and viral persistence of COVID-19. (NCAM1+CD160+) NK cells increased significantly in AS and SM individuals compared with the HC. SM patients showed a significant increase in (LAG3+CD160+CD8+) NKT cells and a decrease in (CD4-CD8-) double negative T cells compared with the AS subjects. (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (SD) than the patients with moderate disease (MD). (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes and (CLEC10A-S100A9lo)pDC were positively and negatively correlated with the age-related disease severity of COVID-19 patients__ respectively. Increases in (CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+) classical monocytes and (CLEC10A-S100A9lo)pDC were associated with long-term nucleic acid test positive (LTNP) patients compared with the short-term nucleic acid test positive (STNP) individuals. Increases in (LAG3+CD160+CD8+) NKTcells and (FOXP3+IL2RA+IL7R+CD4+) Treg cells were observed in a patient lacking B cells and plasma cells. Dramatic increases in neutrophils__ (CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+) classical monocytes__ and (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes were detected at a later stage of a fatal patient. Our findings may enhance our understanding of the immune cell alternations involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection.,GSE165080,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/17
Single-cell ATAC-seq of circulating leukocytes reveals global epigenetic alterations as a prognostic factor in critical illness,Background: While bulk and single cell transcriptomic patterns in circulating leukocytes from trauma patients have been reported__ how these relate to changes in open chromatin patterns remain unstudied. Here__ we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes. Methods: We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4hr__ 24hr__ 72hr post-injury and four matched healthy controls__ and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma__ burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature__ explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo)__ and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness. Findings: Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89__ event set as recovery]__ p=0.01__ n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2__ event set as death]__ p=0.085__ n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33__ event set as death]__ p=0.013__ n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression). Interpretation: The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses. Early detection of both the global epigenetic signature and the known immune transcriptomic patterns associates with the worse prognosis in trauma__ burns and sepsis.,GSE175694,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/02/03

Two subsets of human marginal zone B cells resolved by global analysis of lymphoid tissues and blood [healthy and lupus human blood],B cells generate antibodies that are essential for immune protection__ but their subgroups are poorly defined. Here we perform undirected deep profiling of B cells in matched human lymphoid tissues from deceased transplant organ donors and blood. In addition to identifying unanticipated features of tissue-based B cell differentiation__ we resolve two subsets of marginal zone B (MZB) cells differing in cell surface and transcriptomic profiles__ clonal relationships to other subsets__ enrichment of genes in the NOTCH pathway__ distribution bias within splenic marginal zone microenvironment__ and immunoglobulin repertoire diversity and hypermutation frequency. Each subset is present in spleen__ gut-associated lymphoid tissue__ mesenteric lymph nodes__ and blood. MZB cells and the lineage from which they are derived are depleted in lupus nephritis. Here we show that this depletion is of only one MZB subset. The other remains unchanged as a proportion of total B cells compared to health. Thus__ it is important to factor MZB cell heterogeneity into studies of human B cell responses and pathology.,GSE193867,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/01/21
A genome-scale screen for synthetic drivers of T-cell proliferation,The engineering of patient T-cells for adoptive cell therapies has revolutionised the treatment of several cancer types. However__ further improvements are needed to increase response and cure rates. CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens have been limited to negative regulators of T-cell functions and raise safety concerns due to permanent genome modification. Here we identify positive T-cell regulators via overexpression of ~12__000 barcoded human open reading frames (ORFs). The top-ranked genes increased primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation__ activation__ and secretion of key cytokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. In addition__ we developed a single-cell genomics method (OverCITE-seq) for high-throughput quantification of the transcriptome and surface antigens in ORF-engineered T-cells. The top-ranked ORF__ lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR)__ is typically expressed in myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes. When overexpressed in T-cells__ LTBR induced profound transcriptional and epigenomic remodelling__ increasing T-cell effector functions__ as well as resistance to exhaustion in chronic stimulation settings__ via constitutive activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. LTBR and other top-ranked genes improved antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and gamma delta T-cell responses__ highlighting their potential for future cancer-agnostic therapies5. Our results provide several strategies for improving next generation T-cell therapies via induction of new synthetic cell programmes.,GSE193736,Escherichia coli; Homo sapiens,Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/01/21
T cell characteristics associated with toxicity to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with melanoma [bulk RNA-seq],Severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur in up to 60% of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However__ it remains unknown whether a common baseline immunological state precedes irAE development. Leveraging CyTOF__ single-cell RNA sequencing__ bulk RNA sequencing__ and T cell receptor sequencing to analyze pretreatment blood from metastatic melanoma patients treated with ICIs__ we investigated cellular factors associated with severe irAE development regardless of organ system involvement. Our results demonstrate circulating T cell characteristics associated with ICI-induced toxicity__ with implications for improved diagnostics and clinical management.,GSE186143,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/01/13
Multidimensional single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood reveals characteristic features of the immune system landscape in aging and frailty,Frailty is an intermediate status of human ageing process__ associated with decompensated homeostasis and death. The immune phenotype of frailty and its underlying cellular and molecular processes remain poorly understood. Here we profiled 114__467 immune cells from cord blood__ young adults__ healthy and frail elderly using single-cell RNA and TCR V(D)J sequencing. An age-dependent accumulation of cell heterogeneity and transcriptome variability in defined immune cell types was observed. With the specific expression of gene sets__ characteristic transcription factors were identified in given immune cell types of certain age group. Trajectory analysis revealed cells from non-frail and frail elderly often fall into distinct trajectories__ despite similar chronological age. Numerous TCR clonotypes were shared among T cell subtypes in aged and frail samples__ indicating differential pluripotency and resilience capability of aged T cells. Finally__ a frailty-specific monocyte subset was identified with exclusively high expression of lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1. Our results discover human frailty-specific immune cell characteristics based on the comprehensive dimensions in immune landscape of ageing and frailty.,GSE157007,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2022/01/12
Single-cell RNA-seq data of human Tregs treated with TNFR2 agonist antibody,Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2)__ a membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor receptor expressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs)__ participates in Treg proliferation. Although a specific TNFR2 pathway has been reported__ the signaling mechanism has not been completely elucidated. This study sought to clarify TNFR2 signaling in human Tregs using amplicon sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess Tregs treated with a TNFR2 agonist antibody. Pathway enrichment analysis based on differentially expressed genes highlighted tumor necrosis factor α signaling via nuclear factor-kappa B__ interleukin-2 signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 signaling__ interferon-γ response__ and cell proliferation-related pathways in Tregs after TNFR2 activation. TNFR2-high Treg-focused analysis found that these pathways were fully activated in cancer Tregs__ showing high TNFR2 expression. Collectively__ these findings suggest that TNFR2 orchestrates multiple pathways in cancer Tregs__ which could help cancer cells escape immune surveillance__ making TNFR2 signaling a potential anticancer therapy target.,GSE185144,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/01/10
Well-paired-seq: a Size-exclusion and Locally Quasi-static Hydrodynamic Microwell Chip for Single-cell RNA-seq,High throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology for revealing new cell types and cellular states. However__ the existing droplet or well-based methods are primarily based on the stochastic pairing of single cells and barcoded beads__ resulting in a large number of empty microreactors and a low cell/bead utilization efficiency. Here__ we present Well-paired-seq__ consisting of thousands of size-exclusion and quasi-static hydrodynamic dual wells to address these limitations. The size-exclusion based dual-well structure allowed one cell and one bead to be trapped in the bottom well (cell-capture-well) and the top well (bead-capture-well)__ respectively__ while the quasi-static hydrodynamic principle ensured that the trapped cells were unable to escape from cell-capture-wells__ achieving cumulative capture of cells and buffer exchange in the Well-paired-seq chip. By the integration of quasi-static hydrodynamic and size-exclusion principles__ the structure of the dual-well ensures one cell and one bead pairing with high density__ acheiving high efficiency of cell/bead pairings (~80%) and low cell doublets. The high utilization of microreactors and single cells/beads enable us to achieve an ultra-high throughput (~105 cells ) with low collision rates (6.2%). We demonstrate the technical performance of Well-paired-seq by collecting transcriptome data from around 200__000 cells across 21 samples including various cell lines__ peripheral blood mononuclear cells__ and drug-treated cells__ successfully revealing the heterogeneity of single cells and showing the wide applicability of Well-paired-seq for basic or clinical biomedical research.,GSE192708,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2022/01/04

Fingerprints of Hepatocellular Carcinoma-Infiltrated γδT Cells Revealed by Single-Cell Sequencing,We report the application of single cell RNA sequencing for profiling the fingerprints of γδT cells of hepatocellular carcinoma compared with healthy donors. By comparing the transcriptome and TCR clonality of γδT cells from 3 HCC patients and expanded γδT cells from 3 healthy donors__ we found that expanded γδ T cells derived from different donors shared great transcriptomic similarity and we found higher enrichments of major γδ TCRs in expanded γδ T cells compared to infiltrated but not peripheral ones in HCC. Analysis of differentiation trajectory demonstrated a branched structure in expanded γδ T cells__ implying functional and differentiation stage diversity__ and γδ T cells from HCC patients are localized to the far end of the trajectory. Furthermore__ GVSA analyses made on metabolic pathways demonstrated strong enrichments in major metabolic pathways such as OXPHOS__ glycolysis__ and fatty acid metabolism in expanded γδ T cells versus peripheral ones of HCC. The comparison indicated higher cytotoxicity score of expanded γδ T cells compared to infiltrated or peripheral ones of HCC. The successful application of allogeneic γδ T cells immunotherapy in late-stage liver cancer patients was supported by our current scRNA transcriptomic analyses__ which suggested strong anti-tumor functional complementation by the ex-vivo expanded γδ T cells.,GSE175793,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/12/31

People critically ill with COVID-19 exhibit peripheral immune profiles predictive of mortality and reflective of SARS-CoV-2 lung viral burden,There remains an urgent need to delinate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in critially ill COVID-19 patients. To better understand determinants of mortality__ we performed high dimensional profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critially ill COVID-19 patients. Single-cell RNAseq based characterization of peripheral immune states reveal distinct expression profiles that were predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Temporal analysis revealed a that persistently elevated levels of inflammatory monocyte signatures and persistent interferon signaling preceeded concerted upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Interrogation of lower respiratory tract saples revelaed that infected myeliod cells upregulated CXCL10__ and elevated levels of CXCL10 in plasma were associated with a high risk of death. Overall__ our data suggest a pivotal role for myeloid cell states in severe COVID-19 and may faciliate discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics.,GSE180578,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/12/08

Multiplexed scRNA-seq reveals the cellular and genetic correlates of systemic lupus erythematosus,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Knowledge of circulating immune cell types and cell states associated with SLE remains incomplete. We profiled over 1.2 million PBMCs (162 cases__ 99 controls) with multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq (mux-seq). Cases exhibited prominent expression of type-1 interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in monocytes__ reduction of naïve CD4+ T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression__ and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH+ CD8+ T cells. Cell-type-specific expression features accurately predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes. We integrated dense genotyping data__ mapping cell-type-specific cis-eQTLs and linked known and novel SLE-associated variants to cell-type-specific gene expression. These results demonstrate mux-seq as a systematic approach to characterize cellular composition__ identify transcriptional signatures__ and annotate genetic variants associated with SLE.,GSE174188,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/12/01
Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals pervasive but highly cell type-specific genetic ancestry effects on the response to viral infection,Humans show remarkable variation in susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This heterogeneity arises partially from variation in the immune response__ which is responsible for preventing and controlling infection. To better understand the major factors driving antiviral immune response differences__ we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to measure the effects of genetic ancestry and cis-regulatory variation on the transcriptional response to influenza infection in various immune cell types in 90 European and African American individuals. We show that monocytes are the most responsive to infection but that all cell types engage a conserved__ type I IFN response__ which is stronger in European individuals. Further__ we detect directional__ polygenic differences in expression phenotypes between populations that are under cis-genetic control and show that recent positive selection has acted on putatively causal risk loci associated with common autoimmune disorders. Our findings establish genetic ancestry and common cis-regulatory variants as important determinants governing the antiviral immune response__ thus improving our understanding of the factors that contribute to differences in infectious and complex disease susceptibility.,GSE162632,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/11/26

Allelic variation in Class I HLA determines pre-existing memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 that shape the CD8+ T cell repertoire upon viral exposure,Effective presentation of antigens by HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T cells is required for viral elimination and generation of long-term immunological memory. In this study__ we applied a single-cell__ multi-omic technology to generate the first unified ex vivo characterization of the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 across 4 major HLA class I alleles. We found that HLA genotype conditions key features of epitope specificity__ TCR a/b sequence diversity__ and the utilization of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive memory T cell pools. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed functionally diverse T cell phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells__ associated with both disease stage and epitope specificity. Our results show that HLA variations significantly influence the CD8+ T cell repertoire shape and utilization of immune recall upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.,GSE188429,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/11/10

Single cell analysis of protein epitopes and chromatin accessibility using PHAGE-ATAC [Human_PBMCs],Single cell multi-omic readouts of both the cellular transcriptome and proteome have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehensively characterize cellular states. Most approaches in this area rely on oligonucleotide barcode-conjugated antibodies that target cell surface epitopes of interest__ enabling their concomitant detection with the transcriptome. However__ a similar high-throughput measurement of other cellular modalities such as the epigenome in concert with protein levels have not been described. Moreover__ detection of epitopes is limited to antigens for which a specific antibody is available. Here__ we introduce PHAGE-ATAC__ an approach that enables the scalable and simultaneous detection of protein levels and chromatin accessibility data in single cells using the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Quantitative detection of proteins by PHAGE-ATAC is accomplished through the use of engineerable nanobody-displaying phages that are genetically barcoded within the nanobody-encoding phagemids. We demonstrate the utility of PHAGE-ATAC for multimodal single cell genomic analysis in both cell lines and primary human cells. Analogous to phage display approaches__ we further establish a synthetic high-complexity library of nanobody-displaying phages and demonstrate its utility to select novel antigen-specific nanobodies for PHAGE-ATAC.,GSE157483,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/10/21

single cell transcriptomics and B-cell repertoire data from one vaccinated individual after Boostrix vaccination,The transcriptomics and BCR-rep data was meassured at the single-cell level from the longitudinal samples obtained from an individual following Boostrix vaccination. The donor had no known or suspected exposure to pertussis infection nor vaccination in the past 10 years. EDTA-blood samples for single-cell sequencing were collected at baseline and days 5 (d5)__ d7__ d10 and d14 post-vaccination. At baseline__ first 10__000 total CD19+ B cells were sorted__ and after adjusting the sorting gate to exclusively sort PB/PCs__ another 1__201 CD19+CD38++CD24+CD27+ PB/PCs were sorted. For subsequent visits__ all available PB/PCs were sorted (11__051 cells). In total__ we sorted 22__252 cells. Nearly 22__000 B cells enriched in PB/PCs from different time-points were processed into single cells in a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). Reverse transcription PCR and library preparation were carried out under the Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3 protocol (10X Genomics) per manufacturer’s recommendations. After amplification of the cDNA__ a 5 ́gene expression library and paired heavy and light chain library were generated from cDNA of the same cell using Chromium Single Cell VDJ reagent kit (scBCR-rep library; v1.1chemistry__ 10X Genomics). After library preparation__ quality control was performed using a bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies).

Monitoring CAR T cell generation with a CD8-targeted lentiviral vector by single cell transcriptomics,Quantifying gene expression in individual cells can substantially improve our understanding about complex genetically engineered cell products such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Here we designed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to monitor the delivery of a CD19-CAR gene via lentiviral vectors (LVs)__ i.e. the conventional VSV-LV and the CD8-targeted CD8-LV. LV exposed human donor PBMC were evaluated for a panel of 400 immune-response related genes including LV-specific probes. The resulting data revealed a trimodal expression for the CAR and CD8A demanding for a careful distribution-based identification of CAR T cells and CD8+ lymphocytes in scRNA-seq analysis. The fraction of T cells expressing high CAR levels was in concordance with flow cytometry results. More than 97% of the cells hit by CD8-LV expressed the CD8A gene. Remarkably__ the majority of the potential off-target cells were in fact on-target cells resulting in a target cell selectivity of above 99%. Beyond that__ the differential gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of restriction factors in CAR-negative cells thus explaining their protection from CAR gene transfer. In summary__ we provide a workflow and subsetting approach for scRNA-Seq enabling reliable distinction between transduced and untransduced cells during CAR T cell generation.,GSE184895,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/10/01

10X genomics single cell GEX and VDJ 5' sequencing of PBMC from Type 1 Diabetes patients treated with Treg therapy alone or plus low dose IL-2,Background: A previous Phase I study showed that the infusion of autologous Treg cells expanded ex-vivo into recent onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients had an excellent safety profile__ however__ the majority of the infused Tregs could no longer be detected in the peripheral blood three months post-infusion (NCT01210664-Treg-T1D Trial). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a well-characterized cytokine that has been shown to enhance human Treg cell survival and expansion at low doses in vivo. Therefore__ a Phase 1 study (NCT02772679-TILT trial) was conducted combining a single infusion of autologous polyclonal Tregs__ expanded ex vivo__ followed by one or two 5-day courses of recombinant human low dose IL-2 (ld-IL-2) at 0.3 x 10^6 to 1 x 10^6 units/dose. The infusions had an acceptable safety profile__ but all 9 patients failed to maintain C-peptide production at pre-treatment levels. Results: Single cell gene expression analysis revealed that the combination therapy led to a transient increase in the number of infused and endogenous Tregs but also resulted in a significant increase from baseline in a subset of activated NK__ Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and clonal CD8+ T populations from populations,GSE178991,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/25

Vemurafenib acts as molecular switch in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis,Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplasm marked by the accumulation of CD1a+CD207+ cells. It is most commonly driven by a somatic activating mutation in the BRAF kinase (BRAFV600E). Multisystem disease with risk-organ involvement requires intensive chemotherapy__ making BRAF-inhibitors an attractive option. Here__ we present a comprehensive analysis of the course of an LCH patient treated with the combination of vemurafenib with salvage chemotherapy who achieved complete clinical and molecular remission. We conclusively show that there is no relationship between blood-BRAF levels and clinical presentation during treatment with vemurafenib__ but that vemurafenib leads to a fast__ efficient__ but reversible inhibition of clinical manifestations of high-risk LCH such as cytopenia__ fever__ and hypoproteinemia. In line__ serum levels of inflammatory cytokines exactly mirror vemurafenib administration. Genotyping for the BRAFV600E mutation shows its presence in multiple hematopoietic cell types__ including NK cells and granulocytes. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells at time of diagnosis and during treatment indicate that RAF-inhibition abrogates the expression of inflammatory cytokines previously implicated in LCH. Together__ our data suggest that while the CD1a+CD207+ histiocytes are the hallmark of LCH__ other BRAF-mutated cells themselves contribute significantly to morbidity in patients with multisystem LCH.,GSE175480,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/23
Immune signatures underlying post-acute COVID-19 lung sequelae,Although a substantial proportion of severe COVID-19 pneumonia survivors exhibit long-term pulmonary sequalae__ the underlying mechanisms or associated local and systemic immune correlates are not known. Here__ we have performed high dimensional characterization of the pathophysiological and immune traits of aged COVID-19 convalescents__ and correlated the local and systemic immune profiles with pulmonary function and lung imaging. In this cohort of aged COVID-19 convalescents__ chronic lung impairment was accompanied by persistent systemic inflammation and respiratory immune alterations. Detailed evaluation of the lung immune compartment revealed dysregulated respiratory CD8+ T cell responses that likely underlie the impaired lung function following acute COVID-19 during aging. Single cell transcriptomic analysis identified the potential pathogenic subsets of respiratory CD8+ T cells causing persistent tissue conditions following COVID-19. Our results have revealed key pathophysiological and immune traits that support the development of lung sequelae following SARS-CoV2 pneumonia during aging__ with implications for the treatment of chronic COVID-19 symptoms.,GSE176201,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/09/17
A Single-Cell Atlas of Liver Metastases of Colorectal Cancer Reveals the Reprogramming of the Tumor Microenvironment in Response to Preoperative Chemotherapy,Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is the core question for CRC treatment. However__ the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC is not fully understood__ and its influence on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we provide an in-depth analysis of transcriptional landscape of primary CRC__ matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution__ and perform a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alteration of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111__292 single-cell transcriptomes__ our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast__ in tumors treated with PC__ we find activation of B cells__ lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype__ lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)__ and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC__ and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.,GSE178318,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/10
Residual homing of a α4β7-expressing β1+PI16+ regulatory T cell subset correlates with exposure-efficacy of vedolizumab,In vitro and in vivo data from our lab show that TReg cells exhibit a right-shifted vedolizumab binding profile compared with TEff cells. Consistently__ in a certain concentration range__ the residual adhesion__ transmigration and homing of TReg cells was higher than that of TEff cells. To better understand why vedolizumab binding was different between TReg and TEff in a certain concentration range__ we performed single cell RNA sequencing of Memory CD4 T cells expressing α4 and β7 integrin and compared cells binding to vedolizumab or not binding to vedolizumab (previously purified using FACS with fluorescently labelled vedolizumab).,GSE162624,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/10

Multiomic analysis reveals decidual-specific transcriptional programing of MAIT cells,Problem: Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells have been recently identified at the maternal-fetal interface. However__ transcriptional programming of decidual MAIT cells in pregnancy remains poorly understood. Method of Study: We employed a multiomic approach to address this question. Mononuclear cells from the decidua basalis and parietalis__ and control PBMCs__ were analyzed via flow cytometry to investigate MAIT cells in the decidua and assess their transcription factor expression. In a separate study__ both decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells were analyzed using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) coupled with gene expression analysis. Lastly__ decidual MAIT cells were stimulated with E. coli and expression of MR1 by antigen presenting cells was measured to evaluate decidual MAIT cell function. Results: First__ we identified MAIT cells in both the decidua basalis and parietalis. CITE-seq__ coupled with scRNAseq gene expression analysis__ highlighted transcriptional programming differences between decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells at a single cell resolution. Transcription factor expression analysis further highlighted transcriptional differences between decidual MAIT cells and non-matched peripheral MAIT cells. Functionally__ MAIT cells are skewed towards IFNg and TNFa production upon stimulation__ with E. coli leading to IFNg production. Lastly__ we demonstrate that MR1__ the antigen presenting molecule restricting MAIT cells__ is expressed by decidual APCs. Conclusion: MAIT cells are present in the decidua basalis and obtain a unique gene expression profile. The presence of MR1 on APCs coupled with in vitro activation by E. coli suggests that MAIT cells might be involved in tissue-repair mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface.,GSE183421,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/07
Protein kinase C (PKC)-independent signaling pathways regulate P-TEFb biogenesis in CD4+ T cells to reverse HIV latency,The switch between HIV latency and productive transcription is regulated by an auto-feedback mechanism initiated by the viral trans-activator Tat__ which functions to recruit the host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb to proviral HIV. A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits__ P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in latently infected memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability for proviral transcription are not well-defined. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells__ we sought to identify specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb__ defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Unexpectedly__ cellular treatment with diacylglycerol-mimicking protein kinase C (PKC) agonists in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore was sufficient to stimulate active P-TEFb expression and reactivate latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore__ inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that of the four known isoforms of RasGRP__ the diacylglycerol-dependent Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed isoform in memory CD4+ T cells and should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2 pathway alongside the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and strongly suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore__ contrary to prevailing models__ the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells in response to either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is largely independent of PKC activity but rather primarily involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade namely RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2.,GSE167916,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/07
Inhibition of MET Signaling with Ficlatuzumab in Combination with Chemotherapy in Refractory AML: Clinical Outcomes and High-Dimensional Analysis,Acute myeloid leukemia patients refractory to induction therapy or relapsed within one year have poor outcomes. Autocrine production of hepatocyte growth factor by myeloid blasts drives leukemogenesis in pre-clinical models. A phase Ib trial evaluated ficlatuzumab__ a first-in-class anti-HGF antibody__ in combination with cytarabine in this high-risk population. Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed__ and 20 mg/kg was established as the recommended phase II dose. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was febrile neutropenia. Among 17 evaluable patients__ the overall response rate was 53%__ all complete remissions. Phospho-proteomic mass cytometry showed potent on-target suppression of p-MET after ficlatuzumab and that attenuation of p-S6 was associated with clinical response. Multiplexed single cell RNA sequencing using longitudinally collected patient specimens identified interferon and MYC target genes as adverse predictive factors. The ficlatuzumab and cytarabine combination is well-tolerated with favorable efficacy. High-dimensional analyses at single-cell resolution represent promising approaches for identifying biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance in prospective clinical studies.,GSE162117,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/09/03
Single-cell analysis identifies shared and distinct immune features of COVID-19__ Influenza and other community-acquired pneumonia,The exact immunopathophysiology of COVID-19 remains clouded by methodological heterogeneity and a lack of relevant disease controls. The absence of single-cell investigations into the broader population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PBMCs from a strictly matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19__ eight patients with CAP__ and four non-infectious control subjects. With this balanced__ multi-omic approach we describe diverging transcriptional and phenotypic patterns in T cell__ NK cell and monocyte populations between patients with CAP caused by either SARS-CoV-2__ Influenza A or other pathogens__ and thereby expand our understanding of the peripheral immune response in different forms of CAP.,GSE164948,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/31
Genetic variants and cell-specific signatures in PBMCs of pre transplant recipients,Long-term survival of the renal allograft is a challenge. A single cell sequencing analysis is a powerful approach to identify genetic/genomic risk for development of long-term graft loss at single cell level. In this study__ we compared single cell RNA sequencing profiles of pre-transplant PBMC samples from 4 transplant patients (2 patients with graft loss within 3 years vs 2 patients without graft loss) with simultaneous genome-wide genotype data for common variants to idenitfy the immune cell subtypes and transcriptomic signatures associated with long-term graft loss. These transcriptomic data also integrates with genetic data in an effort to identify genes that mediate the risk for graft survival in a cell-type specific context.,GSE182916,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/29
single-cell RNA-sequencing on human naïve and memory CD4+ T cells during Plasmodium falciparum infection,Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria causes high rates of morbidity and mortality and lacks an effective vaccine. Clinical immunity develops in residents of malaria endemic regions which confers reduced clinical symptoms during infection and protects against severe disease. We hypothesized that understanding the immune mechanisms of clinical immunity could inform vaccine design to improve efficacy. We compared the peripheral blood cellular and humoral immune responses during Pf malaria infection between clinically susceptible and protected participants from a malaria endemic region in Malawi during a prospective 18-month longitudinal study. Participant classifications were defined by the number of recurrent clinical malaria episodes with susceptible participants having more than three while protected less than one episode during the study period. Protected participants exhibited higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) breadth and titers against Pf antigens__ and greater antibody (Ab)-dependent Pf opsonization compared to susceptible participants__ consistent with our classifications. Using high dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and spectral flow cytometry__ and single-cell transcriptomic analyses__ we identified expanded memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes in the blood of protected participants undergoing malaria infection. These cells express a strong cytolytic T helper 1 effector program with transcripts encoding granzymes (A__ B__ H__ M)__ granulysin__ NKG7 and the ZEB2 master transcriptional regulator of terminally differentiated effector T cells. ZEB2+ memory CD4+ T cells were CD39hiTIGIThi and expressed multiple chemotactic and inhibitory receptors. Yet__ their levels of several chemokine and checkpoint inhibitory receptors were reduced in protected compared to susceptible individuals. We propose that clonally expanded ZEB2+ cytolytic memory CD4+ Th1 cells could represent essential contributors to clinical immunity against Pf malaria infection.,GSE182536,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/08/28
Pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6 augments long-term anti-tumor immunity through the induction of T cell memory [02_patient_samples],Small molecule inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are an approved treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and are currently under evaluation across hundreds of clinical trials for other cancer types. The clinical success of these inhibitors is largely attributed to well-defined tumor-intrinsic cytostatic mechanisms__ while their emerging role as immunomodulatory agents is less understood. Using integrated epigenomic__ transcriptomic and proteomic analyses__ we demonstrated a novel action of CDK4/6 inhibitors in promoting the phenotypic and functional acquisition of immunological T cell memory. Short-term priming with a CDK4/6 inhibitor promoted long-term endogenous anti-tumor T cell immunity in mice__ enhanced the persistence and therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells__ and induced an RB-dependent T cell phenotype supportive of favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma patients. Taken together__ these mechanistic insights significantly broaden the prospective utility of CDK4/6 inhibitors as clinical tools to boost anti-tumor T cell immunity.,GSE182651,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/25
Elucidation of tumor-stromal heterogeneity and the ligand-receptor interactome by single cell transcriptomics in real-world pancreatic cancer biopsies,Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)__ we identify substantial transcriptomic evolution of PDOs propagated from the parental tumor__ which may alter predicted drug sensitivity. In addition__ we performed an integrative analyses of PDAC biopsies and provide an in-depth characterization of the heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment__ including cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subclasses__ and predicts for a multitude of ligand-receptor interactions__ revealing potential targets for immunotherapy approaches.,GSE156405,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/25
Single-cell RNA-sequencing of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,We report the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology for single-cell level profiling of the transcriptional features of cells from two primary lesions__ one liver metastasis__ one normal liver tissue__ and peripheral blood monocuclear cells in a patient with metastatic pNET.

Single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses to fatal SFTS,We performed scRNA-seq on 27 PBMC samples from 15 SFTS patients (including four deceased and 11 surviving) and four healthy controls. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed in SFTS and characterized by monocyte shift to intermediate type along with complement activation__ perturbation of plasmablasts composition__ and highly exhausted T cells__ all were correlated with lethal consequences. We identified the overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes across most immune cell types post SFTSV infection__ which were simultaneously related to older age__ high viremia and hyper-inflammation. These data collectively supported the intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTSV infection__ and proposed the pivotal role of IFN-I response in exacerbating hyper-inflammation and lethal SFTS__ which might help to identify therapeutic strategies for SFTS.,GSE175499,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/14
Optimal pooled single-cell RNA-sequencing elucidates gene by environment interactions in circulating immune cells,Decoding the genetic architecture of gene expression remains one of the most important problems in human genetics. Because cellular context is often reflective of environmental exposure__ mapping context-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identifying the cellular contexts that modify their effects is critical for understanding the mechanisms by which gene by environment interactions confer disease risk. Here__ we introduce a compressed pooling framework for performing genetically multiplexed arrayed single-cell sequencing experiments without the need for prior genotyping. To this end__ we developed freemuxlet__ an extension of demuxlet__ that enables genotype-free demultiplexing of pooled single-cell data applicable to multiplexed single cell RNA- and CITE-seq data. In total__ we performed multiplexed CITE-seq across 384 samples from 64 donors over 12 pools in a single day. These results allowed us to generate a map of cell-type specific gene regulatory networks in response to each stimulus. Finally__ by integrating imputed genotypes from the individuals__ we map genetic variants associated with stimulation in each specific cell type and assess their enrichment for disease associations. Freemuxlet and clue together demonstrate the feasibility of performing population-scale gene-by-environment studies using single-cell RNA-sequencing scalable to between 100 – 1000 individuals.,GSE181897,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/12
The Tumor Microenvironment Shapes Innate Lymphoid Cells in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a typical inflammation-associated cancer. Tissue resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been suggested to control tumor surveillance. Here we studied how the local cytokine milieu controls ILCs in HCC. Design: We performed bulk RNA sequencing of HCC tissue as well as flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched ILCs from non-tumor liver__ margin and tumor core derived from 48 HCC patients. Simultaneous measurement of protein and RNA expression at the single-cell level (AbSeq) identified precise signatures of ILC subgroups. In-vitro culturing of ILCs was used to validate findings from in-silico analysis. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from large HCC cohorts allowed stratification and survival analysis based on transcriptomic signatures. Results: RNA sequencing of tumor__ non-tumor and margin identified tumor-dependent gradients of which were not only associated with poor survival but also control ILC plasticity. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry of ILCs from HCC livers identified NK-like cells in the non-tumor tissue__ losing their cytotoxic profile as they transitioned into tumor ILC1 and NK-like-ILC3 cells. Tumor ILC composition was mediated by cytokine gradients that directed ILC plasticity towards activated tumor ILC2s. This was liver-specific and not seen in ILCs from PBMC. Patients with high ILC2/ILC1 ratio expressed IL-33 in the tumor that promoted ILC2 generation which was associated with better survival. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the tumor cytokine milieu controls ILC composition and HCC outcome. Specific changes of cytokines modify ILC composition in the tumor by inducing plasticity and alter ILC function.,GSE179795,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/11

AMULET: A novel read count-based method for effective multiplet detection from single nucleus ATAC-seq data,Similar to other droplet-based single cell assays__ single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data harbor multiplets that confound downstream analyses. Detecting multiplets in snATAC-seq data is particularly challenging due to data sparsity and limited dynamic range (0 reads: closed chromatin__ 1: open on in one parental chromosome allele__ 2: open on in both alleles chromosomes). Yet__ these unique data features offer an opportunity to identify multiplets. ATAC-DoubletDetector (https://ucarlab.github.io/ATAC-DoubletDetector/) AMULET (Atac MULtiplet Estimation Tool) exploits these unique features to detect multiplets by studying enumerates the number of regions with >2 uniquely aligned reads across the genome to effectively detect multiplets - an effective alternative to methods based on artificially-generated multiplets. We evaluated the method by generating snATAC-seq data (e.g.__ state-of-the-art ArchR). For benchmarking we generated snATAC-seq data and generated data fromeasured the efficacy of AMULET inm in two primary human tissues: peripheral human blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pancreatic islet samples. AMULET detects had high multiplets with an estimated precision (estimated via donor-based multiplexing) and high recall (estimated via simulated doublets) compared to alternatives 0.57 precision and achieves 0.85 recall. When and was the most effective when a certain read depth is achieved (a certain read depth per nucleus is achieved samples are sequenced deeply (e.g.__ median read count per nucleus >20K25K) reads per nucleus in PBMCs)__ ATAC-DoubletDetector captured 85% of simulated doublets (i.e.__ recall)__ significantly outperforming ArchR (24%). For lower read depth__ ATAC-DoubletDetector and ArchR produced complementary results. Moreover__ ATAC-DoubletDetector was equally effective in identifying homotypic multiplets (i.e.__ multiplets from the same cell type)__ which are missed by simulation-based methods. Cell-specific marker peaks enabled accurate (85%) tracing of cellular origins of snATAC-seq multiplets. Accordingly__ more abundant cells within a tissue are more likely to form multiplets and the majority of multiplets are homotypic. ATAC-DoubletDetector is a fast and effective multiplet detection/annotation tool for improved single cell epigenomic data analyses across diverse biological systems and conditions.,GSE165212,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/08/11

Distinct transcriptional programs characterize neoantigen-specific T cells in lung cancers treated with neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade [bulk TCR-seq],Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment__ but most patients do not respond. PD-1 blockade “unleashes” CD8 T cells__ including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA)__ but factors in the tumor microenvironment can inhibit responses by dampening MANA-specific T cell function. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics are revealing global T cell dysfunction programs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However__ the vast majority of TIL do not recognize tumor antigens and little is known about transcriptional programs of true MANA-specific TIL. Here__ we use an integrated approach to identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells (MANAFEST) assay in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers and use their TCR CDR3 as barcodes to track them and analyze their transcriptional programs and function in the tumor microenvironment using single cell RNA sequencing. We find both MANA-and virus-specific clones in TIL and adjacent normal lung__ regardless of response status. MANA-specific__ influenza (flu)-specific and EBV-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Most MANA-specific clones are tissue resident memory (TRM) cells__ an incompletely activated cytolytic program__ including EOMES deficiency__ and higher levels of genes encoding T cell inhibitory molecules and Tox2. Notably__ MANA-specific T cells express low levels of IL-7R and are functionally less responsive to IL-7 compared with tissue-resident flu-specific clones. MANA-specific clones from anti-PD-1 non-responding tumors express TCR with markedly lower ligand-dependent signaling capability__ are largely confined to HOBIThi TRM subsets and coordinately up-regulate genes encoding specific checkpoints__ killer inhibitory receptors__ and intracellular inhibitors of T cell activation and cytotoxicity. These findings provide mechanistic and potential therapeutic insights into overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.,GSE176022,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/07/21

A monocyte/dendritic cell molecular signature of SARS-CoV2-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with severe myocarditis [Single cell RNAseq],SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is generally milder than in adults__ yet a proportion of cases result in hyperinflammatory conditions often including myocarditis. To better understand these cases__ we applied a multi-parametric approach to the study of blood cells of 56 children hospitalized with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most severe forms of MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to SARS-CoV-2)__ that resulted in myocarditis__ were characterized by elevated levels of pro-angiogenesis cytokines and several chemokines.

Transcriptomic profile of single-cell sorted monocytes__ T cells and CD3+CD14+ cells from one subject infected with latent tuberculosis,We set out to detect a transcriptional signature in CD4 T cells of individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis. We indeed found such a signature which surprisingly could be tracked to a cell population expressing both T cell (CD3) and monocyte (CD14) markers. To identify the nature of the CD3+CD14+ population__ we determined the transciptomic profile of single cells CD3-CD14+ Monocytes (n=21)__ CD3+D14- T cells (n=22)__ CD3+CD14+ cells in the Monocyte gate (Mgate) (n=22) and CD3+CD14+ cells in the lymphocyte gate (Lgate) (n=20) from one subject infected with latent tuberculosis by RNA sequencing. PCA on all genes showed that CD3+CD14+ cells represent an intermediate population between Monocytes and T cells__ with CD3+CD14+ L gate cells closer to T cells compared to CD3+CD14+ Mgate cells.,GSE117435,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/07/08
Single-cell RNA-seq profiling reveals novel insights in immune-complex deposition and epithelium transition in IgA nephropathy,IgA nephropathy represents the most prevalent chronic nephrosis worldwide. However__ pathogenesis about IgA deposition and end-stage renal failure is still not well defined. Using single-cell RNA-seq__ we identified the mesangial membrane receptor for IgA__ which collaborates with increased extracellular matrix proteins and protease inhibitor to facilitate IgA deposition. Meanwhile__ cell-cell interaction analysis revealed increased communications between mesangium and other cell types__ uncovering how morbidity inside glomerulus spreads to whole kidney__ which results in the genetic changes of kidney resident immune cells. Prominent interaction decreasing in intercalated cells leads to the discovery of a transitional cell type__ which exhibited significant EMT and fibrosis features.

Single Cell Immunophenotyping of Lyme Erythema Migrans (Bulk TCR Repertoire Sequencing),Erythema migrans (EM) is a skin lesion caused by the spirochete B. burgdorferi (Bb) and is a hallmark initial sign of Lyme disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells and innate immune cells mediate local inflammatory cytokine production that promote the reaction. Despite the established importance of B cells and antibodies in preventing Bb infection and resolving disease__ the role of B cells in the skin immune response to Bb is incompletely defined. In this study__ we characterized the immunophenotype of EM lesions and used single cell RNA-Seq to investigate B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in the EM skin lesions and peripheral blood of patients with Lyme disease. We hypothesized that B cells from the circulation__ potentially primed by exposure to Bb antigens in regional draining lymph nodes__ are recruited into EM lesions and play an active role in the local response to infection. We found that B cells are more abundant in the EM lesion in comparison to autologous uninvolved skin and possess distinct characteristics__ including abundant expression of MHCII genes and preferential IgM isotype usage. A subset exhibited low levels of somatic hypermutation despite a gene expression profile more consistent with memory than naïve B cell subsets. Moreover__ infiltrating B cells were clonally expanded and a large fraction could be directly traced to circulating relatives.

Single-cell transcriptomics of peripheral blood reveals a novel B-cell subset in renal allograft recipients with accommodation,Kidney transplantation is a preeminent treatment for end-stage renal disease . The application of immunosuppressants is needed for kidney recipients to avoid allograft rejection but increase the risk of infection__ and balance between rejection and infection is an important in clinical to reach the immune accommodation. Here__ we use single-cell RNA sequencing to fully assess the immune status of peripheral mononuclear cells in kidney recipients. and compared the differences between kidney recipients and healthy people to describe the characteristics of the immune accommodation of kidney recipients. We found a novel B cell subset (CD19+IGKC+IGLC3lowTCL1A-CD127+) of renal transplant recipients with accommodation was significantly lower than that of healthy people and verified by flow cytometry. which may have potential regulatory potential. Furthermore__ we found that IL32 may increase the expression of CD19+IGKC+IGLC3lowTCL1A-CD127+ Bcells. In summary__ we found that the CD19+IGKC+IGLC3lowTCL1A-CD127+B subgroup with immunomodulatory potential is inhibited in kidney recipients with accommodation state__ and IL-32 has therapeutic potential for this.,GSE175429,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/25
"Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals ex vivo signatures of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells through ""reverse phenotyping""",The in vivo phenotypic profile of T cells reactive to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 antigens remains poorly understood. Conventional methods to detect antigen-reactive T cells require in vitro antigenic re-stimulation or highly individualized peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) multimers. Here__ we used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and profile SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To do so__ we induce transcriptional shifts by antigenic stimulation in vitro and take advantage of natural T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of clonally expanded T cells as barcodes for 'reverse phenotyping'. This allows identification of SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs and reveals phenotypic effects introduced by antigen-specific stimulation. We characterize transcriptional signatures of currently and previously activated SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells__ and show correspondence with phenotypes of T cells from the respiratory tract of patients with severe disease in the presence or absence of virus in independent cohorts. Reverse phenotyping is a powerful tool to provide an integrated insight into cellular states of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells across tissues and activation states.,GSE171037,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/25
Tumor-associated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells positively linked to glioblastoma progression,Brain tumors are typically immunosuppressive and refractory to immunotherapies for reasons that remain poorly understood. The unbiased profiling of immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment may reveal immunologic networks affecting therapy and course of disease. Here we identify and validate the presence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within tumor tissues that are positively linked to glioblastoma malignancy. In contrast to the medullary hematopoietic compartment__ tumor-associated HSPCs are comprised of a majority of CD38- immature cells__ such as hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors__ express genes related to glioblastoma progression and display patterns of accelerated cell cycle. When cultured ex vivo__ tumor-associated HSPCs form prevalently myeloid colonies__ suggesting potential in situ myelopoiesis. In experimental models__ HSPCs promote tumor cell proliferation__ expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and secretion of tumor promoting cytokines such as IL-6__ IL-8 and CCL2__ indicating concomitant support of both malignancy and immunosuppression. Additionally__ the frequency of tumor-associated HSPCs is prognostic for patient survival and correlate with immunosuppressive phenotypes. These findings identify a new element in the complex landscape of glioblastoma that may serve as an independent prognostic factor or target for brain tumor immunotherapies.,GSE165238,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/25
High throughput joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and protein levels in single cells [PBMC_Stim_Multiome],Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (scATAC-seq) to simultaneously profile the epigenomic landscape in thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq methods sample genomic DNA accessible to transposases__ but have not previously been combined with measurement of protein levels. Here__ we present ATAC with Select Antigen Profiling by sequencing__ ASAP-seq__ a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels in thousands of single cells__ pairing sparse scATAC data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers__ and optionally__ enriched mtDNA coverage for lineage tracing (mtscATAC-seq) with minimal impact on ATAC-seq data quality. ASAP-seq makes use of a novel bridging approach to utilize existing commercially available antibody:oligo conjugates developed for CITE-seq and related technologies. We demonstrate the utility of ASAP-seq in the context of hematopoietic differentiation__ cell surface marker dynamics following peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation__ and as a combinatorial decoder of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells.,GSE166188,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/05/14
Targeting P300/CBP reveals discrete regulation of transcription and chromatin accessibility by histone acetylation [singlecellseq],To test the long-standing paradigm directly linking histone acetylation with chromatin decompaction and transcriptional output__ we used integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses following acute inhibition of major cellular lysine acetyltransferases P300 and CBP. We discovered that P300/CBP inhibition dynamically perturbs acetylation kinetics and dramatically suppresses core-transcriptional networks in the absence of changes to chromatin accessibility. CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified NCOR1 and HDAC3 transcriptional co-repressors as the principle antagonists of P300/CBP by counteracting acetylation turnover kinetics. Finally__ deacetylation of H3K27 provides nucleation sites for reciprocal methylation switching__ a feature that can be exploited therapeutically by concomitant KDM6A and P300 inhibition. Overall__ this study indicates that the steady-state histone acetylation-methylation equilibrium functions as a molecular rheostat governing cellular transcription that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation as an anti-cancer regimen.,GSE173811,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/11

scRNAseq of Antigen Presenting Cells in severe COVID-19 patients,We isolated PBMC from healthy__ moderate ( Oxygen supply < 10L/min)__ and severe (Oxygen supply >= 10L/min) COVID-19 patients after their admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU)__ at two timepoints (Day-1 and Day-4); and performed both CD14+ Monocyte enrichment followed by a Pan-DC kit to retrieve all Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) subsets from these age-matched patients. We performed single cell RNA sequencing using 10X technology on the single cell suspensions and constracted a high-resolution map of 81__643 Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) from the three COVID-19 severity groups. We were able to retrieve all the known six APC subsets and deciphered the altered pathways and ati-viral mechanisms__ correlated with the disease severity.,GSE169346,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/10
Multi-omic profiling reveals widespread dysregulation of innate immunity and hematopoiesis in COVID-19,Our understanding of protective vs. pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2__ the virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)__ is limited by inadequate profiling of patients at the extremes of the disease severity spectrum. Here__ we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity__ from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic__ epigenomic__ and proteomic analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19__ with the most profound disturbances including prominent hyperactivation signatures in neutrophils and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We also leverage epigenomic analysis to identify loss of accessibility at NF-kB binding sites within pro-inflammatory cytokine gene loci as a potential mechanism for the striking lack of cytokine production observed in monocytes in severe and fatal COVID-19. We further demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19. Collectively__ our results reveal disease severity-associated immune phenotypes in COVID-19 and identify pathogenesis-associated pathways that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.,GSE174072,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/05/08

SINGLE-CELL CHARACTERIZATION OF A MODEL OF POLY I:C-STIMULATED PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS IN SEVERE ASTHMA,Background: Asthma has been associated with impaired interferon response. Multiple cell types have been implicated in such response impairment and may be responsible for asthma immunopathology. However__ existing models to study the immune response in asthma are limited by bulk profiling of cells. Our objective was to Characterize a model of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with severe asthma (SA) and its response to the TLR3 agonist Poly I:C using two single-cell methods. Methods: Two complementary single-cell methods__ DropSeq for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF)__ were used to profile PBMCs of SA patients and healthy controls (HC). Poly I:C-stimulated and unstimulated cells were analyzed in this study. Results: PBMCs (n=9__414) from five SA (n=6__099) and three HC (n=3__315) were profiled using scRNA-Seq. Six main cell subsets__ namely CD4+ T cells__ CD8+ T cells__ natural killer (NK) cells__ B cells__ dendritic cells (DCs)__ and monocytes__ were identified. CD4+ T cells were the main cell type in SA and demonstrated a pro-inflammatory profile characterized by increased JAK1 expression. Following Poly I:C stimulation__ PBMCs from SA had a robust induction of interferon pathways compared with HC. CyTOF profiling of Poly I:C stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs (n=160__000) from the same individuals (SA=5; HC=3) demonstrated higher CD8+ and CD8+ effector T cells in SA at baseline__ followed by a decrease of CD8+ effector T cells after poly I:C stimulation. Conclusions: Single-cell profiling of an in vitro model using PBMCs in patients with SA identified activation of pro-inflammatory pathways at baseline and strong response to Poly I:C__ as well as quantitative changes in CD8+ effector cells. Thus__ transcriptomic and cell quantitative changes are associated with immune cell heterogeneity in this model to evaluate interferon responses in severe asthma.,GSE172495,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/04/22
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the transcriptomic characteristics of Tregs and TNFR2+ Tregs isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood of patients with gastric cancer,This study aimed to explore the characteristics and role of TNFR2+ Tregs in the microenvironment and progression of gastric cancer by single-cell RNA sequencing.We obtained Tregs from tumor tissues and peripheral blood of three GC patients.Through single-cell RNA sequencing__ we found tumor-infiltrating Tregs express high levels of TNFR2. The TNF-a/TNFR2 signaling pathway is activated__ accompanied by upregulation of costimulatory molecules. Compared to blood Tregs__ tumor-infiltrating Tregs exhibit activated and effector states. In addition to expressing costimulatory molecules such as TNFR2__ 4-1BB__ OX40 and GITR__ tumor-infiltrating Tregs are also characterized by high expression of immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4 and TIGIT and chemokines such as CCR6.This study revealed a high infiltration level of TNFR2+ Tregs with the characteristics of activated and effector Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. Our study provides a new theoretical basis for TNFR2+ Tregs as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer.,GSE172131,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/04/16
Single-cell RNA-seq of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in COVID-19,We carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from confirmed COVID-19 inpatients (hospitalized) and outpatients (infected)__ uninfected close contacts (exposed)__ and healthy controls.,GSE171555,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/04/15
Single-cell analysis of chromatin silencing programs in development and tumor progression,Single-cell analysis has become a powerful approach for the molecular characterization of complex tissues. Methods for quantifying gene expression and chromatin accessibility2 of single cells are now well-established__ but analysis of chromatin regions with specific histone modifications has been technically challenging. Here__ we adapt the recently published CUT&Tag method3 to scalable single-cell platforms to profile chromatin landscapes in single cells (scCUT&Tag) from complex tissues. We focus on profiling Polycomb Group (PcG) silenced regions marked by H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in single cells as an orthogonal approach to chromatin accessibility for identifying cell states. We show that scCUT&Tag profiling of H3K27me3 distinguishes cell types in human blood and allows the generation of cell-type-specific PcG landscapes from heterogeneous tissues. Furthermore__ we use scCUT&Tag to profile H3K27me3 in a brain tumor patient before and after treatment__ identifying cell types in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in PcG activity in the primary sample and after treatment.,GSE157910,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/04/12

Single-Cell Omics Reveals Dyssynchrony of the Innate and Adaptive Immune System in Progressive COVID-19 [single-cell RNA-seq],A dysregulated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a critical role in severe COVID-19. However__ the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the virus causes lethal immunopathology are poorly understood. Here__ we utilize multi-omics single-cell analysis to probe dynamic immune responses in patients with stable or progressive manifestations of COVID-19__ and assess the effects of tocilizumab__ an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. Coordinated profiling of gene expression and cell lineage protein markers reveals a prominent type-1 interferon response across all immune cells__ especially in progressive patients. An anti-inflammatory signature in monocytes and a pre-exhaustion phenotype in activated T cells are hallmarks of progressive disease. Single-cell T and B cell receptor repertoire analysis reveal a skewed clonal distribution of CD8 T cells and a primary B cell response with possible contribution from memory B cells.

Immune dysregulation and autoreactivity correlate with disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children. Here__ we define immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing__ antigen receptor repertoire analysis__ unbiased serum proteomics__ and in vitro assays. Despite no evidence of active infection__ we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways including cytokines__ complement/coagulation__ and fluid shear stress in MIS-C patients. Moreover__ NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated__ and plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded. Consistently__ we detect elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Thus__ we define immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children.,GSE166489,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/04/02
Simultaneous trimodal single cell measurement of transcripts__ epitopes__ and chromatin accessibility using TEA-seq,Single-cell measurements of cellular characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation__ cellular responses to signals__ and human disease. Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state__ but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case__ we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: Integrated Cellular Indexing of Chromatin Landscape and Epitopes (ICICLE-seq). We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures Transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)__ Epitopes__ and chromatin Accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells__ which we term TEA-seq. Together__ these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.,GSE158013,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/04/02

Multimodal Analysis for Human ex vivo Studies Shows Extensive Molecular Changes from Delays in Blood Processing,Multi-omic profiling of human peripheral blood is increasingly utilized to identify biomarkers and pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease. The importance of these platforms in clinical and translational studies led us to investigate the impact of delayed blood processing on the numbers and state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the plasma proteome. Similar to previous studies__ we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMCs up to 18 hours. In contrast__ profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology. Differences accumulating during an overnight rest (18 hours) could confound relevant biologic variance related to many underlying disease states.,GSE156989,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/03/29

Identification and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell response with immunodominant features,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a continuous challenge worldwide__ and there is an urgent need to map the landscape of immunogenic and immunodominant epitopes recognized by CD8 T cells. Here__ we analyze samples from 31 COVID-19 patients for CD8 T cell recognition of 500 peptide-HLA class I complexes__ restricted by 10 common HLA alleles. We identify 18 CD8 T cell recognized SARS-CoV-2 epitopes__ including an epitope with immunodominant features derived from ORF1ab and restricted by HLA-A*01:01. In-depth characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses of patients with acute critical and severe disease reveals high expression of NKG2A__ lack of cytokine production and a gene expression profile inhibiting T cell re-activation and migration while sustaining survival. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses are detectable up to 5 months post recovery from critical and severe disease__ and these responses convert from dysfunctional effector to functional memory CD8 T cells during convalescence.,GSE169503,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/03/25
Longitudinal single-cell epitope and RNA-sequencing reveals the immunological impact of type 1 interferon autoantibodies in critical COVID-19,Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies have been found in some critical COVID-19 patients; however__ their prevalence and longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale__ and functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown. Here__ in 284 COVID-19 patients__ we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical__ 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600__000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single- cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients__ 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls__ revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases__ including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover__ surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies__ supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.,GSE168453,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/03/09
The memory B cell response to influenza vaccination is impaired in older persons,Influenza imparts an age-related increase in mortality and morbidity. The most effective countermeasure is vaccination; however__ vaccines offer modest protection in older adults. To investigate how ageing impacts the memory B cell response we tracked haemagglutinin specific B cells by indexed flow sorting and single cell RNA sequencing in twenty healthy adults administered the trivalent influenza vaccine. We found age-related skewing in the memory B cell compartment six weeks after vaccination__ with younger adults developing haemagglutinin specific memory B cells with an FCRL5+ “atypical” phenotype__ showing evidence of somatic hypermutation and positive selection__ which happened to a lesser extent in older persons. We confirmed the germinal center ancestry of these FCRL5+ “atypical” memory B cells using scRNASeq from fine needle aspirates of influenza responding human lymph nodes and paired blood samples. Together__ this study shows that the aged human germinal center reaction and memory B cell response following vaccination is defective.,GSE167823,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/03/05

Dynamic changes in human single cell transcriptional signatures during fatal sepsis,Systemic infections__ especially in patients with chronic diseases__ result in sepsis: an explosive__ uncoordinated immune response that can lead to multisystem organ failure with a high mortality rate. Sepsis survivors and non-survivors oftentimes have similar clinical phenotypes or sepsis biomarker expression upon diagnosis__ suggesting that the dynamics of sepsis in the critical early stage may have an impact on these opposite outcomes. To investigate this__ we designed a within-subject study of patients with systemic gram-negative bacterial sepsis with surviving and fatal outcomes and performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected during the critical period between sepsis recognition and 6 hours. We observed that the largest sepsis-induced expression changes over time in surviving versus fatal sepsis were in CD14+ monocytes__ including gene signatures previously reported for sepsis outcomes. We further identify changes in the metabolic pathways of both monocytes and platelets__ the emergence of erythroid precursors__ and T cell exhaustion signatures__ with the most extreme differences occurring between the non-sepsis control and the sepsis non-survivor. Our single-cell observations are consistent with trends from public datasets but also reveal specific effects in individual immune cell populations__ which change within hours. In conclusion__ this pilot study provides the first single-cell results with a repeated measures design in sepsis to analyze the temporal changes in the immune cell population behavior in surviving or fatal sepsis. These findings indicate that tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell-types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes. We also identify molecular pathways that could be therapeutically controlled to improve the sepsis trajectory toward better outcomes.,GSE167363,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/03/03

Identifying CNS-colonizing T cells as potential therapeutic targets to prevent progression of multiple sclerosis,Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS)__ an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS)__ can be suppressed in its early stages but eventually becomes clinically progressive and unresponsive to therapy. Here we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood brain barrier. Methods: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497__705 single cell transcriptomes and 355__433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA-sequencing we localize these cells in post-mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples__ 85__000 spot transcriptomes). Findings: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/LTB+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly__ our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course__ as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Conclusions: As a consequence__ we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression. Funding: This study was supported by funding from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf__ the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft__ the OAK Foundation__ Medical Research Council UK and Wellcome.,GSE144744,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/02/16
Time-resolved Systems Immunology Reveals a Late Juncture Linked to Fatal COVID-19,COVID-19 exhibits extensive clinical heterogeneity ranging from asymptomatic infection to death. Unraveling the basis of immune response differences across individuals is critical for developing effective therapeutics and prophylactics. We longitudinally assessed 192 surface protein markers__ the transcriptome__ and T-cell receptor sequence profiles simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from COVID-19 patients__ and compared to age-matched healthy control samples.,GSE161918,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/02/10
DNA hypomethylating agents increase activation and cytolytic activity of CD8+ T-cells,DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) induce Type I/III interferon signaling through dsRNA-mediated viral mimicry in cancer cells. Yet__ the direct effects of HMAs in immune cells remains less clear. Here__ we demonstrate that HMA treatments can directly modulate the anti-tumor response and effector function of CD8+ T-cells. In vivo HMA treatment promotes CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and supresses tumor growth via CD8+ T-cell dependent activity. HMAs enhances primary human CD8+ T-cells activation markers__ effector cytokine production__ and anti-tumor cytolytic activity. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling shows that HMAs vastly regulate T-cell activation related transcriptional networks__ culminating with over-activation of NFATc1 short-isoforms. Mechanistically__ demethylation of an intragenic CpG Island immediately downstream to the 3'UTR of the short isoform was associated with anti-sense transcription and alternative polyadenylation of NFATc1 short-isoforms. High-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) analyses reveal a selective effect of HMAs on a subset of human CD8+ T-cell subpopulations__ resulting in an increase in both number and abundance of a granzymeBhigh__ perforinhigh effector subpopulation. Overall__ our findings support the use of HMAs as a therapeutic strategy to boost anti-tumor immune response.,GSE151917,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/02/08

Single Cell Transcriptomic Characterization of CAR T-Cell Products Reveals Subpopulations__ Stimulation and Exhaustion Signatures,Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell adoptive therapy is set to transform the treatment of a rapidly expanding range of malignancies. Although the activation process of normal T cells is well characterized__ comparatively little is known about the activation of cells via the CAR. Here we have used flow cytometry together with single cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the starting material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells –PBMCs-) and CAR therapeutic products of 3 healthy donors in the presence and absence of antigen specific stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis of the 57__676 single cell transcriptomes showed the CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells__ with the cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor__ and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of the underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature__ with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion. Comprehensive single cell transcriptomic analysis thus represents a powerful way to guide the assessment and optimization of clinical-grade CAR-T-cells__ and inform future research into the underlying molecular processes.,GSE145809,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/22
Systematic comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for immune cell profiling [PBMC_10X],We systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines__ simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluate methods by their cell recovery rate__ library efficiency__ sensitivity__ and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5’ v1 and 3’ v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer drop-out events which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.,GSE164402,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/15
Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data,The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities__ known as multimodal analysis__ represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates new computational methods that can define cellular states based on multiple data types. Here__ we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis__ an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell__ enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover__ we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets__ and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets__ including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state__ and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.,GSE164378,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2021/01/15

Single-cell RNA Sequencing reveals the expansion of Cytotoxic CD4+ T lymphocytes and the heterogeneity of pathogenesis in primary Sjögren’s syndrome patients,By single cell RNA sequencing__our data revealed disease-specific immune cell subsets and provide some potential new targets of pSS__ specific expansion of CD4+ CTLs may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS__ which might give a valuable insights for therapeutic interventions of pSS.,GSE157278,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/15
Outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to MAIT cell activation and cytotoxicity,Immune system dysfunction is paramount in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and fatality rate. MAIT cells are innate-like T cells involved in mucosal immunity and protection against viral infections. Here__ we studied the immune cell landscape__ with emphasis on MAIT cells__ in cohorts of 208 patients at various stages of disease activity. MAIT cell frequency is strongly reduced in blood. They display a strong activated and cytotoxic phenotype that is more pronounced in lungs. Blood MAIT cell alterations positively correlate with other innate cell activation; pro-inflammatory cytokines__ notably IL-18; and with the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified a monocyte/macrophage Interferon-a-IL-18 cytokine shift and the ability of infected macrophages to induce cytotoxicity of MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. Together our results suggest that altered MAIT cell functions due to IFN-a-IL-18 imbalance contribute to disease severity and their therapeutic manipulation might prevent deleterious inflammation in COVID-19 aggravation.,GSE164386,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/08
Single cell RNA-seq reveals developmental plasticity with coexisting oncogenic states and immune evasion programs in ETP-ALL,This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,GSE161901,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/01
Single cell RNA-seq reveals developmental plasticity with coexisting oncogenic states and immune evasion programs in ETP-ALL [Patients_TALLs_scRNA-seq],Lineage plasticity and stemness have been invoked as the cause of therapy resistance in cancer__ as these flexible states allow cancer cells to de-differentiate and alter their dependencies. We investigated such resistance mechanisms in relapsed / refractory early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying activating NOTCH1 mutations__ by full-length single cell RNA sequencing of malignant and microenvironmental cells. We identified two highly distinct stem-like states that critically differ in their cell-cycle and oncogenic signaling. Fast-cycling stem-like leukemia cells demonstrate Notch activation and are effectively eliminated in patients by Notch inhibition__ while slow cycling stem-like cells are Notch-independent but rather rely on PI3K signaling__ likely explaining the poor efficacy of Notch inhibition in this disease. Remarkably__ we find that both stem-like states can differentiate into a more mature leukemia state with prominent immune-modulatory functions__ including high expression of the LGALS9 checkpoint molecule. These cells promote an immunosuppressive leukemia ecosystem with clonal accumulation of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that express HAVCR2__ the cognate receptor for LGALS9. Our study identifies complex interactions between signaling programs__ cellular plasticity and immune programs that characterize T-ALL and illustrates the multi-dimensionality of tumor heterogeneity. In this scenario__ combination therapies targeting diverse oncogenic states and the immune ecosystem appear most promising to successfully eliminate tumor cells that escape treatment through co-existing transcriptional programs.,GSE161895,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/01
Temporally integrated single cell RNA sequencing analysis of controlled and natural DENV-1 infections,Controlled dengue human challenge studies present a unique opportunity to address many longstanding questions in the field of flavivirus biology. These fundamental questions include defining the early immunological signatures of infection__ the host/environmental factors that impact disease severity__ and the role of preexisting immunity on the development of symptomatic viral infection. However__ while several controlled dengue human challenge studies have been performed and appear to clinically recapitulate may features of mild natural DENV infection__ limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by these attenuated challenge viruses compares to the profile associated with a natural__ unattenuated DENV infection. To bridge this knowledge gap__ we performed scRNAseq analysis on longitudinally collected PBMC samples obtained from 3 individuals (8 time points per subject) enrolled in the SUNY/WRAIR DENV-1 controlled human challenge study. In addition__ 3 time points (two acute infection time points__ one control time point) from two individuals experiencing a natural DENV-1 infection were analyzed and computationally integrated with the challenge model dataset. This temporally integrated dataset contains a total of 171__208 cells and 22 statistically distinct populations corresponding to all major anticipated leukocyte subsets. While all identified cell populations demonstrated significant and consistant perturbations in their transcriptional profile in response to either natural or experimental DENV infection__ conventional monocytes respond most robustly to infection across all subjects and study groups from an unbiased transcriptional perspective. Using these data__ core sets of genes that were consistently induced by either natural or experimental DENV were identified__ and the overlap between the two arms of the study assessed.,GSE154386,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2021/01/01
A Roadmap from Single-Cell Transcriptome to Patient Classification for the Immune Response to Trauma,Immune dysfunction is an important factor driving mortality and adverse outcomes after trauma but remains poorly understood__ especially at cellular level. To deconvolute the trauma-induced immune response__ we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to circulating and bone marrow mononuclear cells in injured mice and circulating mononuclear cells in trauma patients. In mice__ the greatest changes in gene expression were seen in monocytes across both compartments. After systemic injury__ the gene expression pattern of monocytes markedly deviated from steady state with corresponding changes in critical transcription factors (TFs)__ which can be traced back to myeloid progenitors. These changes were largely recapitulated in the human single-cell analysis. We generalized the major changes in human CD14+ monocytes into six signatures__ which further defined two trauma patient subtypes (SG1 vs. SG2) identified in the whole blood leukocyte transcriptome in the initial 12h after injury. Compared with SG2__ SG1 patients exhibited delayed recovery__ more severe organ dysfunction and a higher incidence of infection and non-infectious complications. The two patient subtypes were also recapitulated in burn and sepsis patients__ revealing a shared pattern of immune response across critical illness. Our data will be broadly useful to further explore the immune response to inflammatory diseases and critical illness.,GSE162806,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/12/16
Single-cell RNA sequencing of Tocilizumab-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an in vitro model of inflammation,COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to global health. Early data has revealed that IL-6__ a key regulatory cytokine__ plays an important role in the cytokine storm of COVID-19. Multiple trials are therefore looking at the effects of Tocilizumab__ an IL-6 receptor antibody that inhibits IL-6 activity__ on treatment of COVID-19__ with promising findings. As part of a clinical trial looking at the effects of Tocilizumab treatment on kidney transplant recipients with subclinical rejection__ we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of comparing stimulated PBMCs before and after Tocilizumab treatment. We leveraged this data to create an in vitro cytokine storm model__ to better understand the effects of Tocilizumab in the presence of inflammation. Tocilizumab-treated cells had reduced expression of inflammatory-mediated genes and biologic pathways__ particularly amongst monocytes. These results support the hypothesis that Tocilizumab may hinder the cytokine storm of COVID-19__ through a demonstration of biologic impact at the single-cell level.,GSE163014,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/12/11
Single cell RNA sequencing of advanced gastric cancer,To define the cellular characteristics of malignant ascites of advanced gastric cancer patients and search for therapeutic strategies__ we applied single cell RNA sequencing to cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAM)__ present in large numbers in malignant ascites. We analyzed 180 cells from 4 malignant ascites and 1 cerebrospinal fluid metastasis. The results indicate that the anti-inflammatory characteristics of the tumor associated macrophages are concocted by the tumor cells. By constructing reference transcriptomes for M1 and M2 type macrophages__ we found a strong non-inflammatory property of macrophages recovered from the malignant ascites of gastric cancer.,GSE140182,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/12/10
Characterization of the immunologic impact of sarcoidosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells via single-cell RNA-seq,Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by infiltration of immune cells into granulomas. Previous gene expression studies using heterogeneous cell mixtures lack insight into cell-type-specific immune dysregulation. We performed the first single-cell RNA-sequencing study of sarcoidosis in peripheral immune cells in 48 patients and controls. Following unbiased clustering__ differentially expressed genes were identified for 18 cell types and bioinformatically assessed for function and pathway enrichment. Our results reveal persistent activation of circulating classical monocytes with subsequent upregulation of trafficking molecules. Specifically__ classical monocytes upregulated distinct markers of activation including adhesion molecules__ pattern recognition receptors__ and chemokine receptors__ as well as enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways HMGB1__ mTOR__ and ephrin receptor signaling. Predictive modeling implicated TGFβ and mTOR signaling as drivers of persistent monocyte activation. Additionally__ sarcoidosis T cell subsets displayed patterns of dysregulation. CD4 naïve T cells were enriched for markers of apoptosis and Th17/Treg differentiation__ while effector T cells showed enrichment of anergy-related pathways. Differentially expressed genes in regulatory T cells suggested dysfunctional p53__ cell death__ and TNFR2 signaling. Using more sensitive technology and more precise units of measure__ we identify cell-type specific__ novel inflammatory and regulatory pathways. Based on our findings__ we suggest a novel model involving four convergent arms of dysregulation: persistent hyperactivation of innate and adaptive immunity via classical monocytes and CD4 naïve T cells__ regulatory T cell dysfunction__ and effector T cell anergy. We further our understanding of the immunopathology of sarcoidosis and point to novel therapeutic targets.,GSE132338,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/12/01
Tumour Heterogeneity and Intercellular Networks of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma at Single Cell Resolution,The heterogeneous nature of tumour microenvironment (TME) underlying diverse treatment responses remains unclear in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here__ we profile 176__447 cells from 10 NPC tumour-blood pairs__ using single-cell transcriptome coupled with T cell receptor sequencing. Our analyses reveal 53 cell subtypes__ including tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T__ regulatory T (Treg)__ and dendritic cells (DCs)__ as well as malignant cells with different Epstein-Barr virus infection status. Trajectory analyses reveal exhausted CD8+ T and immune-suppressive TNFRSF4+ Treg cells in tumours might derive from peripheral CX3CR1+CD8+ T and naïve Treg cells__ respectively. Moreover__ we identify immune-regulatory and tolerogenic LAMP3+ DCs. Noteworthily__ intensive inter-cell interactions are observed among LAMP3+ DCs__ Treg__ exhausted CD8+ T__ and malignant cells__ suggesting potential cross-talks to foster an immune-suppressive niche for the TME. Collectively__ our study uncovers the heterogeneity and interacting molecules of the TME in NPC at single-cell resolution__ which provide insights into the mechanisms underlying NPC progression and the development of precise therapies for NPC.,GSE162025,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2020/11/24
Gene-regulatory network analysis of ankylosing spondylitis with a single-cell chromatin accessible assay,A detailed understanding of the gene-regulatory network in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is vital for elucidating the mechanisms of AS pathogenesis. Assaying transposase-accessible chromatin in single cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a suitable method for revealing such networks. Thus__ scATAC-seq was applied to define the landscape of active regulatory DNA in AS. As a result__ there was a significant change in the percent of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs__ and 37 differentially accessible transcription factor (TF) motifs were identified. T cells__ monocytes-1 and dendritic cells were found to be crucial for the IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway__ since they had 73 potential target genes regulated by 8 TF motifs with decreased accessibility in AS. Moreover__ natural killer cells were involved in AS by increasing the accessibility to TF motifs TEAD1 and JUN to induce cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. In addition__ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells may be vital for altering host immune functions through increasing the accessibility of TF motifs NR1H4 and OLIG (OLIGI and OLIG2)__ respectively. These results explain clear gene regulatory variation in PBMCs from AS patients__ providing a foundational framework for the study of personal regulomes and delivering insights into epigenetic therapy.,GSE157595,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/11/18
No detectable alloreactive transcriptional responses under standard sample preparation conditions during donor-multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells,We employed an experimental design where PBMCs from a single donor was sequenced with or without mixing with PBMCs from other healthy unrelated donors in order to determine whether PBMCs engage in an allogeneic response under standard scRNA-seq sample preparation conditions (e.g.__ 30 minute co-incubation at 4C),GSE161329,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/11/13
Characterisation of CD4+ T-cell subtypes using single cell RNA sequencing and the impact of cell number and sequencing depth,CD4+ T-cells represent a heterogeneous collection of specialised sub-types and are a key cell type in the pathogenesis of many diseases due to their role in the adaptive immune system. By investigating CD4+ T-cells at the single cell level__ using RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)__ there is the potential to identify specific cell states driving disease or treatment response. However__ the impact of sequencing depth and cell numbers__ two important factors in scRNA-seq__ has not been determined for a complex cell population such as CD4+ T-cells. We therefore generated a high depth__ high cell number dataset to determine the effect of reduced sequencing depth and cell number on the ability to accurately identify CD4+ T-cell subtypes. Furthermore__ we investigated T-cell signatures under resting and stimulated conditions to assess cluster specific effects of stimulation. We found that firstly__ cell number has a much more profound effect than sequencing depth on the ability to classify cells; secondly__ this effect is greater when cells are unstimulated and finally__ resting and stimulated samples can be combined to leverage additional power whilst still allowing differences between samples to be observed. These results will inform future scRNA-seq studies to ensure the most efficient experimental design.,GSE147928,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/11/13
Single cell RNA-seq for PBMC from rheumatoid arthritis patient,The transcriptome of PBMC from rheumatoid arthritis patient hasn't been compenhensively profiled__ and heterogeneous characteristics of blood monocytes in RA patients are much unknown.

Single-cell  analysis  of  adipose tissue  T cells in diabetic persons with HIV  reveals high proportions of clonally expanded CMV-like CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic RNA transcriptomes,Persons with HIV have a disproportionate burden of metabolic disease__ including type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the accumulation of chronically activated T cells in the adipose tissue of HIV+ persons is a central mechanism promoting local macrophage activation__ impaired adipocyte function__ and the development of HIV-associated glucose intolerance. Prior studies of immune activation and HIV-associated metabolic disease have only measured circulating T cell subsets. In contrast__ in our study we recruited a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy ranging from insulin sensitive to overtly diabetic__ in addition to HIV-negative diabetic controls__ to identify potential mechanistic linkages between adipose-resident T cell cytokine signaling__ adipose tissue inflammation__ and glucose intolerance in HIV+ persons. This study may also provide further insight into the role of T cells in the development of glucose intolerance in HIV-negative patients.,GSE159759,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/10/22
Imbalance of regulatory and cytotoxic SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in COVID-19,The contribution of CD4+ T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here__ we present a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients__ we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper (TFH) cells and cytotoxic T helper cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2__ and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly__ in hospitalized COVID-19 patients__ a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional T helper (TH)1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together__ our analyses provide so far unprecedented insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.,GSE152522,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/10/06
Multimodal Mapping of the Tumor and Peripheral Blood Immune Landscape in Human Pancreatic Cancer,This is a human single cell sequencing repository of pancreatic cancer tumor tissue and PBMCs of pancreatic cancer patients.

Molecular signatures of inflammatory profile and B-cell function in SFTS patients,Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome banyangvirus (SFTSV) induces immunopathogenic disease with high fatality rate. Despite serious health concern__ the mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations are largely unknown. Here__ we applied targeted proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics analyses to examine the differential immune landscape of SFTS patient blood. Serum immunoprofiling distinguished Low-risk and High-risk clusters of SFTS patients with differential inflammatory cytokine levels__ which matched with disease severity. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of SFTS patient blood at different infection state showed pronounced expansion of B cells with the alteration of B-cell subset populations__ specifically in fatal patients. Furthermore__ plasma cells were the primary reservoir of SFTSV replication with the downregulation of IFN pathway. This study identifies not only the molecular signatures of serum inflammatory profile and B cell lineage population__ but also plasma cells as the viral reservoir in SFTSV-induced fatal patients__ suggesting the alteration of B cell function linked to SFTS lethal infection.,GSE149313,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/10/01

Genetic landscape and autoimmunity of monocytes in developing Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder affecting multiple organs__ including eyes__ skin__ and central nervous system. It is known that monocytes significantly contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. However__ the subset heterogeneity with unique functions and signatures in human circulating monocytes and the identity of disease-specific monocytic populations remain largely unknown. Here__ we employed an advanced single-cell RNA sequencing technology to systematically analyze 11259 human circulating monocytes and genetically defined their subpopulations. We constructed a precise atlas of human blood monocytes，identified 6 subpopulations: including S100A12-; HLA-; CD16-; proinflammatory-; megakaryocyte-like-; and NK-like-monocytes subsets__ and uncovered 2 previously unidentified subsets: HLA- and megakaryocyte-like monocyte subsets. Relative to healthy individuals__ cellular composition__ gene expression signatures__ and activation states were markedly alternated in VKH patients utilizing cell type-specific programs__ especially the CD16- and proinflammatory monocyte subpopulation. Notably__ we discovered a disease-relevant subgroup__ proinflammatory monocytes__ which showed a discriminative gene expression signature indicative of inflammation__ antiviral activity__ and pathologic activation__ and converted into pathologic activation state implicating the active inflammation during VKH disease. Additionally__ we found the cell type-specific transcriptional signature of proinflammatory monocytes__ ISG15__ which could act as a disease biomarker to more accurately reflect disease activity and treatment response than symptom evaluation. Taken together__ in this landmark study we present novel discoveries on accurate classification__ molecular markers__ and signaling pathways for VKH disease-associated monocytes and therapeutically targeting this proinflammatory monocyte subpopulation would provide an attractive approach for treating VKH as well as other autoimmune diseases.,GSE148020,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/09/20
High throughput joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and protein levels in single cells [PBMC stimulation],Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (scATAC-seq) to simultaneously profile the epigenomic landscape in thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq methods sample genomic DNA accessible to transposases__ but have not previously been combined with measurement of protein levels. Here__ we present ATAC with Select Antigen Profiling by sequencing__ ASAP-seq__ a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels in thousands of single cells__ pairing sparse scATAC data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers__ and optionally__ enriched mtDNA coverage for lineage tracing (mtscATAC-seq) with minimal impact on ATAC-seq data quality. ASAP-seq makes use of a novel bridging approach to utilize existing commercially available antibody:oligo conjugates developed for CITE-seq and related technologies. We demonstrate the utility of ASAP-seq in the context of hematopoietic differentiation__ cell surface marker dynamics following peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation__ and as a combinatorial decoder of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells.,GSE156473,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/09/08

Coupled single cell RNA-seq and intracellular protein activity reveals immune-suppressive role of Trem2 in cancer II,Cell function and activity is regulated through integration of signaling__ epigenetic__ transcriptional and metabolic pathways. Here we introduce INs-seq__ an integrated technology for massively parallel recording of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein activity. We demonstrate the broad utility of INs-seq for reveling new immune subsets by profiling different intracellular signatures of immune signaling__ transcription-factor combinations and metabolic activity. Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 1 expressing cells within tumor models__ a metabolic immune signature of suppressive activity__ discovers a novel Arg1+ Trem2+ regulatory myeloid cell (Mreg) and identifies markers__ metabolic activity and pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice inhibits the accumulation of intra-tumoral Mreg cells__ leading to a marked decrease in dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and intra-cellular maps__ and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid suppressive cells in tumors.,GSE150876,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/08/12
Natural display of nuclear-encoded RNA on the cell surface and its impact on cell interaction [SurfaceFISHSeq],Compared to proteins__ glycans__ and lipids__ much less is known about RNAs on the cell surface. We developed a series of technologies to test for any nuclear-encoded RNAs that are stably attached to the cell surface and exposed to the extracellular space__ hereafter called membrane-associated extracellular RNAs (maxRNAs).

Microglia require CD4 T cells to complete the fetal to adult transition,The blood brain barrier has long been thought to isolate the brain from the adaptive immune system. While CD4 T cells have been reported in the central nervous system__ their presence in the healthy brain remains controversial__ and their function at this site unknown. Here we have used a combination of imaging__ single cell and surgical approaches to identify a unique CD69+ CD4 T cell population in both the mouse and human brain__ which is distinct from circulating CD4 T cells. The brain-resident population was derived through in situ differentiation from activated circulatory cells__ and was shaped by interaction with the gut microbiome and self-antigen in the brain. Single cell sequencing revealed that in the absence of murine CD4 T cells__ resident microglia remained suspended between a fetal and adult state. This maturation defect resulted in excess immature neuronal synapses and behavioral abnormalities in the adult mouse. These results illuminate a role for CD4 T cells in the basic developmental processes of the brain__ and a potential interconnected dynamic between the evolution of the immunological and neurological systems.,GSE146165,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/27

Severely ill COVID-19 patients display impaired exhaustion features in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells,The molecular properties of CD8+ T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known. Here__ we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80__000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells__ obtained using a modified Antigen-Reactive T cell Enrichment (ARTE) assay__ from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was ‘exhausted’ or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast__ SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the dominant non-exhausted subset from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation__ pro-survival NF-κB signaling__ and anti-apoptotic pathways__ suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects displayed polyfunctional features and enhanced glycolysis. Cells with such features were largely absent in SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Overall__ our single-cell analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8+ T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2.,GSE153931,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/22

High-throughput single-cell mitochondrial DNA genotyping reveals properties of clonal variation in human contexts [CD34-PBMC-invivo-scATAC],Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells__ current methodologies are limited by scale. Here__ we introduce a high-throughput__ droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further__ the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy__ clonal lineage__ cell state__ and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A>G)__ which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further__ using somatic mtDNA mutations__ we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia__ linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo. ,GSE148508,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/13

Single Cell RNA Sequencing Identifies an Early Monocyte Gene Signature in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results from overwhelming pulmonary inflammation. We used single cell RNA sequencing to probe ARDS at a higher resolution for insights into ARDS pathogenesis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with pneumonia and sepsis with early ARDS were compared to that of sepsis patients who did not develop ARDS. Monocyte clusters from ARDS patients revealed multiple distinguishing characteristics in comparison to monocytes from patients without ARDS including down-regulation of SOCS3 expression accompanied by a pro-inflammatory signature with up-regulation of multiple type I IFN-induced genes__ especially in CD16+ cells. These data show that monocytes of ARDS patients up-regulate expression of genes not just restricted to those associated with inflammation. Together__ our findings identify molecules that are likely involved in ARDS pathogenesis that may inform biomarker and therapeutic development.,GSE151263,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/10
Large-scale production of human iPSC-derived macrophages for drug screening,Tissue resident macrophages are key players in inflammatory processes and their activation and functionality is crucial in health and disease. Diseases associated with alterations in homeostasis or dysregulation of the innate immune system are numerous and include allergic reactions__ autoimmune diseases as well as cancer. Hence__ these cells are of high interest in drug development. Currently__ the main sources of macrophages used in drug development are still primary cells isolated from blood or tissue__ or immortalized cell lines (e.g. THP-1). Here__ we describe an improved method for large-scale production of tissue resident macrophages from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in unprecedented yields. For this__ iPSC-derived macrophages are thoroughly characterized to confirm their cell identity and thus their suitability for screening purposes. We demonstrate that this method to generate macrophages from iPSC overcomes the limitations of using primary cells__ i.e. donor variability and limited availability of large cell numbers. Notably__ the cells recapitulate key functional characteristics__ including cytokine release__ phagocytosis and migration. Genetic modifications can be introduced at the macrophage progenitor stage__ so this methodology will facilitate the generation of reporters and gain- and loss-of-function mutants in an isogenetic background__ essential assets for target validation.,GSE149377,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/07
Small RNA transcriptome analysis by parallel single cell small RNA sequencing (PSCSR-seq),miRNA and other forms of small RNA are now known to regulate many biological processes__ and miRNA profiling is already used biomedically for cancer diagnosis__ staging__ progression__ prognosis__ and to evaluate responsivity to treatment. However__ there is no robust analytical method capable of dissecting the individual miRNA expression profiles from the highly heterogeneous cells comprising tumor samples. Here__ we developed parallel single cell small RNA sequencing (PSCSR-seq)__ which enables highly sensitive and high-throughput miRNA expression profiling of individual cells. We applied PSCSR-seq to examine the small RNA profiles from large numbers of cultured cancer cells__ human PBMCs__ and from a tumor in a melanoma mouse model. We anticipate that PSCSR-seq can be broadly applied for small RNA analysis in cancer research and more generally in life science.,GSE134004,Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/07
Immunophenotyping of COVID-19 and Influenza Underscores the Association of Type I IFN Response in Severe COVID-19,Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild COVID-19__ some patients suffer from severe COVID-19__ which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19__ we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors__ patients with mild or severe COVID-19__ and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs__ particularly upregulation of the TNF/IL-1beta-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19__ type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1beta-driven inflammation__ and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19 infection. Based on this__ we propose that the type I IFN response exacerbates inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.,GSE149689,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/07/06
GMM-Demux: sample demultiplexing__ multiplet detection__ experiment planning and novel cell type verification in single cell sequencing.,Identifying and removing multiplets is essential to improving the scalability and the reliability of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Multiplets create artificial cell types in the dataset. We propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based multiplet identification method__ GMM-Demux. GMM-Demux accurately identifies and removes multiplets through sample barcoding__ including cell hashing and MULTI-seq. GMM-Demux uses a droplet formation model to authenticate putative cell types discovered from a scRNA-seq dataset. We generated two in-house cell hashing datasets and compared GMM-Demux against three state-of-the-art sample barcoding classifiers. We show that GMM-Demux is stable__ highly accurate and recognized 9 multiplet-induced fake cell types in a PBMC dataset.,GSE152981,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/06/24
Discovery of CD80 and CD86 as recent activation markers on regulatory T cells by protein-RNA single-cell analysis,Background: Traditionally__ the transcriptomic and proteomic characterisation of CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level has been performed by two largely exclusive types of technologies: single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and antibody-based cytometry. Here we present a multi-omics approach allowing the simultaneous targeted quantification of mRNA and protein expression in single-cells and investigate its performance to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations. Methods: We have quantified the single-cell expression of 397 genes at the mRNA level and up to 68 proteins using oligo-conjugated antibodies (AbSeq) in 43__656 primary CD4+ T cells isolated from blood and 31__907 CD45+ cells isolated from blood and matched duodenal biopsies. We explored the sensitivity of this targeted scRNA-seq approach to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations and identify trajectories of functional T-cell differentiation. Results: We provide a high-resolution map of human primary CD4+ T cells__ and identify precise trajectories of Th1__ Th17 and regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation in blood and tissue. The sensitivity provided by this multi-omics approach identified the expression of the B7 molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of CD4+ Tregs__ and we further demonstrated that B7 expression has the potential to identify recently activated T cells in circulation. Moreover__ we identified a rare subset of CCR9+ T cells in blood with gut-homing properties and expression of several immunomodulatory receptors__ suggestive of a regulatory function at barrier sites. Conclusions: This transcriptomic and proteomic hybrid technology provides a cost-effective solution to dissect the heterogeneity of immune cell populations__ including more precise and detailed descriptions of the differentiation and activation of circulating and tissue-resident cells in response to therapies and in stratification of patients.,GSE150060,Homo sapiens,Other,2020/06/12

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of allergen-specific T cells in allergy and asthma [scRNA-Seq],CD4+ helper T cells (TH) and regulatory T cells (Treg) that respond to common allergens play an important role in driving and dampening airway inflammation in patients with asthma. Until recently__ direct__ unbiased molecular analysis of allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells has not been possible. To better understand the diversity of these T cell subsets in allergy and asthma__ we analyzed the single-cell transcriptome of ~50__000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells and Treg cells from asthmatics with HDM allergy and from three control groups: asthmatics without HDM allergy and non-asthmatics with and without HDM allergy. Our analyses show that HDM allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells are highly heterogeneous__ and certain subsets are quantitatively and qualitatively different in subjects with HDM-reactive asthma. The number of interleukin (IL)-9 expressing HDM-reactive TH cells is greater in asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics with HDM allergy__ and display enhanced pathogenic properties. More HDM-reactive Th and Treg cells expressing the interferon-response signature (THIFNR and TregIFNR) are present in asthmatics without HDM allergy compared with those with HDM allergy. In cells from these subsets (THIFNR and TregIFNR)__ expression of TNFSF10 was enriched; its product__ TRAIL__ dampens activation of TH cells. These findings suggest that the THIFNR and TregIFNR subsets may dampen allergic responses__ which may help explain why only some people develop TH2 responses to nearly ubiquitous allergens.,GSE146170,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/06/10

Signaling state and abundance of circulating immune cell subpopulations determine cancer response to immunotherapy,We profiled 70__781 peripheral immune cells taken before__ during__ and after treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers using single cell RNA sequencing. Prior to therapy__ responders had a higher relative abundance of undifferentiated (naïve) CD4+ T cells__ while non-responders had more differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory (EM) cells. Further__ the EM cells present in responders were exhausted__ suggesting prior recognition of tumor. Upon anti-PD-1 treatment__ T cells of responders showed a shift towards increased differentiation and a higher relative abundance of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells than non-responders__ with both populations and monocytes showing striking activation of interferon and MHC processing pathways. In addition to T cells__ responders were enriched in classical monocytes prior to therapy__ with a predominance of high TNF-α and growth factor activity associated with inhibition of NF-κB. The number and signaling activation states of T cells and classical monocytes__ as well as their evolution soon after the initiation of therapy__ may be predictive markers of immunotherapy response.,GSE130157,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/06/09

Intratumoral CD4+ T cells mediate anti-tumor cytotoxicity in human bladder cancer,Responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy occur but are infrequent in bladder cancer. The specific T cells that mediate tumor rejection are unknown. T cells from human bladder tumors and non-malignant tissue were assessed with single-cell RNA and paired T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 30__604 T cells from 7 patients. We find that the states and repertoire of CD8+ T cells are not altered in tumors compared with non-malignant tissues. In contrast__ single-cell analysis of CD4+ T cells demonstrates several tumor-specific states__ including multiple distinct states of regulatory T cells. Surprisingly__ we also find multiple cytotoxic CD4+ T cell states that are clonally expanded. These CD4+ T cells can kill autologous tumor in an MHC class II-dependent fashion and are suppressed by regulatory T cells. Further__ a gene signature of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in tumors predicts a clinical response in 244 metastatic bladder cancer patients treated with anti-PD-L1.,GSE149652,Homo sapiens,Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/06/01

Prox-seq: Simultaneous quantification of proteins__ protein complexes and mRNA in single-cells via proximity-sequencing,A novel assay based on proximity ligation assay for high-throughput quantification of proteins__ protein complexes and mRNA in single cells Here we present proximity-sequencing (Prox-seq)__ a method for simultaneous measurement of an individual cell’s proteins__ protein complexes and mRNA. Prox-seq utilizes deep sequencing and barcoded proximity assays to measure proteins and their complexes from all pairwise combinations of targeted proteins__ without any prior knowledge of which proteins can form complexes. The number of measured protein complexes scales quadratically with the number of targeted proteins__ allowing for unparalleled multiplexing capacity. We developed a high-throughput experimental and computational pipeline and demonstrated the potential of Prox-Seq for multi-omic analysis with a panel of 13 proximity probes__ enabling the measurement of 91 protein complexes__ along with thousands of mRNA molecules in single T cells and B cells. Prox-seq is compatible with current single-cell RNA sequencing assays__ such as Drop-seq and Smart-seq2. Prox-seq provides access to an untapped yet powerful measurement modality for single-cell phenotyping and has the potential to discover new protein interactions in single-cells.,GSE149574,Homo sapiens,Other,2020/05/16

Epigenetic regulator genes direct the fate of multipotent precursor cell of origin in lineage switched MLL-AF4 leukaemia [RNA-Seq],Malignant transformation in a multipotential precursor has recently been shown to underlie mixed phenotype acute leukaemias. In contrast__ and despite the conclusive demonstration that MLL-AF4 infant ALL arises in utero. In order to address this we purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) populations from four non-lineage switching presentation infant ALL cases and one ALL presentation which went on to lineage switch at relapse. The specific MLL-AF4 fusion event was determined in unsorted samples by LDI-PCR and identified in purified populations by nested PCR. In three cases where non-lineage restricted populations were able to be purified__ MLL-AF4 was identified in the CD34+CD38-CD45RA+ population (LK228__ LK230__ LS01)__ the CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90- multipotential progenitor population (MPP__ LS01) and even a candidate CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population (LK228) Interestingly__ in a single non-switched MLL-AF9 case analysed for external comparison__ the fusion was only identified in CD19+ blast/B cell populations__ not in any HSPC population. Unexpectedly__ we were also able to identify the presence of the MLL-AF4 fusion in apparently normally differentiated CD34-CD19/3-HLA-DR+CD14/11c+ monocytes/dendritic cells from the peripheral blood/bone marrow of 4/5 cases examined. This finding was further supported by single cell analysis of LS01PALL which identified the fusion in 2/22 CD34-CD19/3-HLA-DR+CD14/11c+ monocytes/dendritic cells analysed. Furthermore__ the matched AML sample (LS01RAML) also contained MLL-AF4 positive mature T lymphoid cells. These data imply that MLL-AF4 does not impose a complete block on normal haematopoietic differentiation__ and raise the question of what additional factors contribute to leukaemic lineage determination in the setting of the MLL-AF4 translocation. To examine the functional capacity of MLL-AF4 transformed precursor cells we generated a patient-derived xenograft model using NOD-scid/IL2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Serial xenotransplantation identified an MLL-AF4 positive clone persisting within the human CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ compartment across four generations of mice__ confirming self-renewal of this population. Together these data identify an early multipotent progenitor or HSC as the putative cell of origin for MLL-AF4 ALL. Furthermore__ they demonstrate that MLL-AF4__ uniquely amongst MLL fusion genes__ imposes a profound lymphoid bias on the developing leukemia but without completely abolishing broader__ non-malignant__ haematopoietic differentiation.,GSE132396,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/04/21

Single cell transcriptome mapping reveals cell type-specific effects on gene expression by acute delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol,The study identifies cell type specific differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells affected by THC infusion in two human subjects. Individual gene expression gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis show that THC affects gene expression in the functional domains of immune response and cell proliferation. One of THC receptor genes__ CNR2__ is highly expressed in B cells and THC perbute CNR2 co-expressed genes in B cells.

Defective SEC61α1 underlies a novel cause of autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia,The molecular cause of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is unknown in 30-50% of patients. SEC61A1 encodes the α subunit of the heterotrimeric SEC61 complex__ which governs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptide-dependent protein transport and passive calcium leakage. Recently__ autosomal dominant mutations in SEC61A1 were reported to be pathogenic in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and glomerulocystic kidney disease. However the full spectrum of clinical manifestations in SEC61A1 mutations is yet to be explored. We investigated a SCN patient__ the only child of healthy non-consanguineous Belgian parents. We identified a de novo private missense mutation in SEC61A1 (c.A275G;p.Q92R; CADD 24.5; msc 6.099) in the patient. The mutation results in diminished expression of the protein in PBMC and fibroblasts__ and an increase in calcium leakage from the ER. In vitro differentiation of CD34+ cells recapitulated the patient’s clinical arrest in granulopoiesis. The impact of Q92R-SEC61α1 on neutrophil maturation was validated using HL-60 cells__ where transduction reduced differentiation into CD11b+CD16+ cells. A potential mechanism for this defect is the uncontrolled initiation of the unfolded protein stress response (UPR)__ with single-cell analysis of primary bone-marrow revealing perturbed UPR in myeloid precursors__ and in vitro differentiation of primary CD34+ cells into neutrophils revealing upregulation of the pro-apoptotic CHOP and BiP UPR-response genes. Together__ these results support specific autosomal dominant mutations in SEC61A1 causing SCN through dysregulation of the UPR.,GSE137496,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/04/09

A targeted multi-omic analysis approach measures protein expression and low abundance transcripts on the single cell level,High throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) has become a frequently used tool to assess immune cell function and heterogeneity. Recently__ the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression by sequencing was developed__ which is commonly known as CITE-Seq. Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcript__ but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore__ there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets. Here__ we describe a novel targeted transcriptomics approach that combines analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on more than 25__000 cells. This targeted approach requires only about 1/10 of the read depth compared to a whole transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts. To analyze these multi-omic transcript-protein datasets__ we adapted One-SENSE for intuitive visualization of the relationship of proteins and transcripts on a single-cell level.,GSE135325,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2020/03/30

Inference and effects of barcode multiplets in droplet-based single-cell assays,A widespread assumption for single-cell analyses specifies that one cell’s nucleic acids are predominantly captured by one oligonucleotide barcode. However__ we show that ~13-21% of cell barcodes from the 10x Chromium scATAC-seq assay may have been derived from a droplet with more than one oligonucleotide sequence__ which we call “barcode multiplets”. We demonstrate that barcode multiplets can be derived from at least two different sources. First__ we confirm that  approximately 4% of droplets from the 10x platform may contain multiple beads. Additionally__ we find that approximately 5% of beads may contain detectable levels of multiple oligonucleotide barcodes. We show that this artifact can confound single-cell analyses__ including the interpretation of clonal diversity and proliferation of intra-tumor lymphocytes. Overall__ our work provides a conceptual and computational framework to identify and assess the impacts of barcode multiplets in single-cell data.,GSE143197,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2020/01/07

Integrated single cell analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes in multiple sclerosis,Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protects the central nervous system (CNS) and analyzing CSF aids the diagnosis of CNS diseases__ but our understanding of CSF leukocytes remains superficial. Here__ using single cell transcriptomics__ we identified a specific border-associated composition and transcriptome of CSF leukocytes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) – an autoimmune disease of the CNS – increased transcriptional diversity in blood__ but increased cell type diversity in CSF including a higher abundance of cytotoxic phenotype T helper cells. A new analytical approach__ named cell set enrichment analysis (CSEA) identified a cluster-independent increase of follicular T helper (TFH) cells potentially driving the known expansion of B lineage cells in the CSF in MS. In mice__ TFH cells accordingly promoted B cell infiltration into the CNS and the severity of MS animal models. Immune mechanisms in MS are thus highly compartmentalized and indicate ongoing local T/B cell interaction.,GSE138266,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/12/10

Single-cell RNA-sequencing of skin__ fresh blood__ and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and healthy volunteers,Purpose: Determine new therapeutic targets for a refractory drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/DRESS using single cell transcriptomic analysis. Methods: Skin cells were dissociated from skin biopsies of a patient with DRESS and 5 healthy volunteers using enzymatic digestion__ then viable skin cells were sorted using flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood using Ficoll-paque density separation. PBMCs were cultured with or without medications for 4 days. In detail__ 200__000 PBMCs were cultivated in 200ul of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% human AB serum with (PBMC_T4_BACT) or without (PBMC_T4_CTRL) 48 ug/mL sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). For the in vitro therapeutic experiments__ PBMCs were cultured in the presence of SMX-TMP with (DRESS_Day4_TOFA) or without (DRESS_Day4_BACT) tofacitinib. The patient was treated with 10mg/d of tofacitinib__ a JAK3 inhibitor. The freshly isolated PBMCs were collected again two weeks after initiation of intervention (PBMC_POST2W). Single cells from the skin__ freshly isolated PBMCs__ and culture PBMCs were captured using droplet based single-cell approach (10x Genomics) and library were prepared. Results: The lymphocytes in skin and PBMCs exhibited upregulation of skin-homing chemokine receptors__ CCR4 and CCR10__ and JAK3 and STAT1. Treatment with tofacitinib dramatically extinguished skin inflammation in a chronic refractory case of DiHS/DRESS. Conclusions: A successful intervention with tofacitinib in a refractory case of DiHS/DRESS was guided by the use of scRNAseq__ which demonstrated aberrant activity in the JAK-STAT pathway.,GSE132802,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/06/17

Ultra-High Throughput Single Cell Analysis of Proteins and RNAs by Split-pool Synthesis,We report a method enabling simultaneous__ ultra-high throughput single-cell-barcoding__ of millions of cells for targeted single cell analysis of proteins and RNAs. This method termed Quantum Barcoding (QBC) circumvents the need to isolate single cells by building cell-specific oligo barcodes dynamically within each cell. With minimal instrumentation (four 96-well plates and a multichannel pipette) cell-specific codes are added to each tagged molecule within cells. This is accomplished through sequential rounds of the well-established process of classic “split-pool synthesis”. We demonstrate the utility of this currently research use only technology in multiple model systems.,GSE130784,Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,Other; Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/05/07
High-throughput tissue dissection and cell purification with digital cytometry [scRNA-Seq],Tissue composition is a major determinant of phenotypic variation and a key factor influencing disease outcomes. Although scRNA-Seq has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity__ it is currently impractical for large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. To overcome these challenges__ we extended Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) into a new platform for in silico cytometry. Our approach enables the simultaneous inference of cell type abundance and cell type-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) from bulk tissue transcriptomes. The utility of this integrated framework__ called CIBERSORTx__ is demonstrated in multiple tumor types__ including melanoma__ where single cell reference profiles are used to dissect primary clinical specimens__ revealing cell type-specific signatures of driver mutations and immunotherapy response. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single cell profiling efforts__ enabling cost-effective__ high throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies__ disaggregation__ or viable cells.,GSE127471,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/05/06

High-throughput combinatorial indexing enables scalable single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling [PBMC],While recent technical advancements have facilitated the mapping of epigenomes at the single-cell resolution__ the throughput and quality of these methods have limited the widespread application of these technologies. Here__ we describe a high-throughput platform for single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) using droplet microfluidics that yields essential qualities for high-throughput profiling__ including improvements in per-cell library complexity and throughput. This approach enables robust cell-typing of complex tissues and reveals a de novo atlas of cellular and epigenomic diversity across many cell types and cell stages.,GSE123577,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/05/02
Single cell RNAseq of human TCRVdelta 1 and TCRVdelta 2 gammadelta T lymphocytes purified from healthy adults blood,γδ T lymphocytes represent ~1% of human PBMC and even more cells in most tissues of vertebrates. Although they have important anticancer functions__ most current scRNA-Seq studies do not identify γδ T lymphocytes since their transcriptomes at the single cell level are unknown. Here we show that high resolution clustering of large scRNA-Seq data sets and a combination of gene signatures allow the specific detection of human γδ T lymphocytes and identification of their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets in large data sets from complex cell mixtures. In t-SNE plots from blood and tumor samples__ the few γδ T lymphocytes appear collectively embedded between cytotoxic CD8 T and NK cells. Their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets form close yet distinct sub-clusters respectively neighbouring NK and CD8 T cells owing to expression of shared and distinct cytotoxic maturation genes. Similar pseudo-time maturation trajectories of TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 γδ T lymphocytes were discovered__ unveiling in both subsets an unattended pool of TEMRA cells with preserved proliferative capacity__ a finding confirmed by in vitro proliferation assays. Overall__ the single cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual gd T lymphocytes from different CMV+ and CMV- donors reflect cytotoxic maturation stages driven by the immunological history of donors. This landmark study establishes the rationale for identification__ subtyping and deep characterization of human γδ T lymphocytes in further scRNA-Seq studies of complex tissues in physiological and disease conditions.,GSE128223,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/05/01
Massively parallel single-cell chromatin landscapes of human immune cell development and intratumoral T cell exhaustion,Understanding complex tissues requires single-cell deconstruction of gene regulation with precision and scale. Here we present a massively parallel droplet-based platform for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in tens of thousands of single cells per sample (scATAC-seq). We obtain and analyze chromatin profiles of over 200__000 single cells in two primary human systems. In blood__ scATAC-seq allows marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements__ mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity__ and reconstruction of trajectories of differentiation from progenitors to diverse and rare immune cell types. In basal cell carcinoma__ scATAC-seq reveals regulatory landscapes of malignant__ stromal__ and immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover__ scATAC-seq of serial tumor biopsies before and after PD-1 blockade allows identification of chromatin regulators and differentiation trajectories of therapy-responsive intratumoral T cell subsets__ revealing a shared regulatory program driving CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development in association with clinical response. We anticipate that droplet-based single-cell chromatin accessibility will provide a broadly applicable means of identifying regulatory factors and elements that underlie cell type and function.,GSE129785,Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/04/16
Single-cell profiling of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,GSE124899,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/03/25
Single-cell profiling of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma reveals underlying heterogeneity predicting with disease progression.,Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL)__ encompassing a spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the skin__ have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40 years. Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive form of CTCL characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for SS reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy__ due in part to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. Using single-cell sequencing of RNA__ we confirm that SS is a clonal disease__ but we further define a more complex model featuring distinct transcriptomic states within SS. Our analysis showed the involvement of FOXP3+ malignant T cells during clonal evolution__ transitioning from FOXP3+ T cells to GATA3+ or IKZF2+ (HELIOS) tumor cells. Transcriptomic diversities in a clonal tumor can be used to predict disease stage__ and we were able to characterize a gene signature that predicts disease stage with close to 80% accuracy. Supporting the critical role of FOXP3+ T cell involvement during clonal evolution__ FOXP3 was found to be the most important factor to predict early disease in SS__ along with another 19 genes used to predict CTCL stage. This work offers insight into the heterogeneity of SS__ providing better understanding of the transcriptomic diversities within a clonal tumor__ which can predict tumor stage and thereby offer guidance of therapy.,GSE122703,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/03/22
A Bayesian mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data from population studies,Abstract: The recently developed droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it feasible to perform a population-scale scRNA-seq study__ in which the transcriptome is measured for tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals. Despite the advances of many clustering methods__ there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here__ we develop a BAyesian Mixture Model for Single Cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood and lung cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy__ particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals. Data purpose: To evaluate the performance of BAMM-SC for clustering droplet-based scRNA-seq data in population-based study__ we performed single cell RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from whole blood obtained from 4 healthy donors__ and on lung cells isolated from streptococcus pneumonia (SP) infected and naïve mice.,GSE128066,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/03/09
Combined chemosensitivity and chromatin profiling prioritizes drug combinations in CLL,The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has substantially improved therapeutic options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although ibrutinib is not curative__ it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities__ we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples collected before and during ibrutinib therapy__ we identified characteristic ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design of ibrutinib combination therapies. Specifically__ we observed and validated preferential sensitivity to proteasome__ PLK1__ and mTOR inhibitors during ibrutinib treatment. More generally__ our study establishes a broadly applicable method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug responses in primary patient samples.,GSE100672,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2019/01/26
Dysfunctional CD8+ T cells form a proliferative__ dynamically regulated compartment within human melanoma [scRNA-seq],Tumor immune cell compositions play a major role in response to immunotherapy but the heterogeneity and dynamics of immune infiltrates in human cancer lesions remain poorly characterized. Here we identify conserved intratumoral CD4 and CD8 T cell behaviors in scRNA-seq data from 25 melanoma patients. We discover a large population of CD8 T cells showing continuous progression from an early effector “transitional” into a dysfunctional T cell state. CD8 T cells that express a complete cytotoxic gene set are rare__ and TCR sharing data suggest their independence from the transitional and dysfunctional cell states. Notably__ we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major intratumoral proliferating immune cell compartment and that the intensity of the dysfunctional signature is associated with tumor-reactivity. Our data demonstrate that CD8 T cells previously defined as exhausted__ are in fact a highly proliferating__ clonal and dynamically differentiating cell population within the human tumor microenvironment.,GSE123139,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/12/27
Organoid modeling of the tumor immune microenvironment,The interaction of neoplastic cells with their tumor microenvironment (TME) is required for cancer progression. However__ in vitro cancer models__ including recent in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures of primary human tumors__ are typically comprised exclusively of neoplastic epithelium__ with stromal and/or immune interactions requiring artificial reconstitution. As relevant to cancer immunotherapy__ the unified co-culture of primary tumor epithelia with their endogenous__ syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a cohesive unit has remained particularly elusive. Here__ we used a single 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) methodology to successfully propagate 3D Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids (PDOs) as primary tumor epithelia together with native immune and myofibroblast stromal compartments without reconstitution. Derived from >100 diverse human surgically resected tumor samples or from murine tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent mice__ PDOs preserved cancer histologic subtypes and mutational spectrum with endogenous T__ B__ NK cells and macrophages integrally embedded amidst the tumor epithelium. PDO-based TILs accurately recapitulated the T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum of the original tumors__ as determined by a robust droplet-based immune profiling solution that links gene expression and immune repertoire in single cells. Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment of organoids from murine tumors from syngeneic immunocompetent hosts induced activation and cytolytic activity of tumor antigen-specific TILs__ indicating successful PDO modeling of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-tumor immunity. Crucially__ the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab activated TILs in PDOs from human lung__ renal and melanoma clinical tumor resections. The organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with its endogenous immune stroma should facilitate mechanistic investigation of TME-specific local tumor immunity__ with applications for functional testing of individualized patient immunotherapy responses.,GSE111360,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,2018/12/13
Single cell dissection of plasma cell heterogeneity in symptomatic and asymptomatic myeloma,Multiple myeloma (MM)__ a plasma cell (PC) malignancy__ is the second most common blood cancer. Despite extensive research__ disease heterogeneity within and between patients is poorly characterized__ hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here__ we apply single cell RNA-seq to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the MM progression spectrum. We define malignant PC at single cell resolution__ demonstrating high inter-patient variability that can be explained by expression of known MM drivers and additional putative factors. Within newly diagnosed patients__ we identify extensive sub-clonal structures for 10/29 patients. In asymptomatic patients with early disease and in minimal residual disease post-treatment__ we detect tumor PC for a subset of the patients__ with the same drivers of active myeloma. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells (CTC) allows detection of malignant PC__ which reflect the BM disease. Our work establishes scRNA-seq for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.,GSE117156,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/12/07
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella dysregulates the repertoire of dendritic cell responses to intracellular and extracellular stimuli [bulk RNA-seq],Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are among of the most important food-borne pathogens. Recently__ a highly invasive multi-drug resistant S. Typhimurium of a distinct multilocus sequence type (MLST)__ ST313__ has emerged across sub-Saharan Africa as a major cause of lethal bacteraemia in children and immunosuppressed adults. Encounters between dendritic cells (DCs) and invading bacteria determine the course of infection but whether or how ST313 might usurp DC mediated defence has not been reported. Here we utilised fluorescently labelled invasive and non-invasive strains of Salmonella combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptomes of individual infected and bystander DCs. The transcriptomes displayed a repertoire of cell instrinsic and extrinsic innate response states that differed between invasive and non-invasive strains. Gene expression heterogeneity was increased in DCs challenged with invasive Salmonella. DCs exposed but not harbouring invasive Salmonella exhibited a hyper-activated profile that likely facilitates trafficking of infected cells and dissemination of internalised intact bacteria. In contrast__ invasive Salmonella containing DCs demonstrate reprogramming of trafficking genes required to avoid autophagic destruction. Furthermore__ these cells displayed differential expression of tolerogenic IL10 and MARCH1 enabling CD83 mediated adaptive immune evasion. Altogether our data illustrate pathogen cell-to cell variability directed by a Salmonella invasive strain highlighting potential mechanisms of host adaption with implications for dissemination in vivo.,GSE111545,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/10/25

Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To generate more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries__ we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets__ enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in both a cell-centric and gene-centric mode to isolate mRNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries.,GSE119428,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/09/04

The patient had a 22 month clinical response followed by late/acquired resistance. We performed scRNAseq using the 10x genomics 3' Chromium expression assay to determine potential mechanisms contributing to immunotherapy response and late resistance,GSE117988,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/09/01

Sensitive and powerful single-cell RNA sequencing using mcSCRB-seq,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a central genome-wide method to characterize cellular identities and processes. Consequently__ improving its sensitivity__ flexibility__ and cost-efficiency can advance many research questions. Among the flexible plate-based methods__ single-cell RNA barcoding and sequencing (SCRB-seq) is highly sensitive and efficient. Here__ we systematically evaluate experimental conditions of this protocol and find that adding polyethylene glycol considerably increases sensitivity by enhancing cDNA synthesis. Furthermore__ using Terra polymerase increases efficiency due to a more even cDNA amplification that requires less sequencing of libraries. We combined these and other improvements to develop a scRNA-seq library protocol we call molecular crowding SCRB-seq (mcSCRB-seq)__ which we show to be one of the most sensitive__ efficient__ and flexible scRNA-seq methods to date.,GSE103568,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/07/26
PBMC Fixation and Processing for Chromium Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,Background: Interest in single-cell whole transcriptome analysis is growing rapidly__ especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works__ investigators have used live cells which represent several inconveniences and limitations. Some recent cell fixation methods did not work with most primary cells including immune cells. Methods: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve PBMCs for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10X Chromium platform. Results: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps__ we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS__ not at cell fixation and up to three-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3X saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3X SSC were successfully implemented into 10X Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol was validated in CD8+ T cell and several other cell types. Conclusions: We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will substantially enable complex experimental design with primary cells at single cell resolution.,GSE112845,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/07/25
TCR repertoire of effector CCR7-CD38+ cells accumulating during experimental infection with Typhoidal Salmonella,In order to characterize pathogen specific T cell responses against Salmonella volunteers challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) or Salmonella Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi). we used mass cytometry__ to identify effector CD4+ T cells circulating during infection. We identified a population of CCR7-CD38+ cells accumulating during infection__ and via unbiased single cell cloning and expansion we demonstrated that these CCR7-CD38+ cells are enriched in Salmonella specific T cells. In this experiment we performed TCR repertoire analysis of CCR7-CD38+ and CCR7-CD38- cells to determine the clonality of CCR7-CD38+ cells__ the overlap between the repertoire of CCR7-CD38+ cells and of non-activated effector CCR7-CD38- cells__ and to identify within CCR7-CD38+ and CCR7-CD38- cells the presence of the CDR3b TCR sequence of the pathogen specific T cell clones isolated from CCR7-CD38+ cells,GSE113112,Homo sapiens,Other,2018/05/13
Simultaneous multiplexed amplicon sequencing and transcriptome profiling in single cells,We developed a tunable ligation technology to alter beads used for to capture mRNA for single-cell RNA sequencing (e.g. Drop-seq); we call this technique droplet assisted RNA targeting by single cell sequencing__ or DART-seq. In the study__ we applied the new technology to capture viral genome transcripts of recombinant type 3 Dearing orthoreovirus infecting murine L929 cells. In addition to capture of targeted viral gene transcripts__ we were also able to simultaneosly pull-down polyadenylated mRNA from the L929 cells to observe host-pathogen interactions. We also applied the technology to efficiently measure natively paired heavy and light chain amplicons from B lymphocyte cells in a collection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,GSE113675,Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/04/26

Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects__ with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly__ we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor.

However__ little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation__ their functional properties__ heterogeneity and clonal diversity__ especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity__ transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. The single-cell differential gene expression analysis__ revealed a spectrum of known transcripts__ including several linked to cytotoxic and co-stimulatory function__ and transcripts of unknown cytotoxicity-related function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA subset__ which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs__ compared to cells in the central and effector memory subsets (TCM__ TEM). Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects__ with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly__ we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and thus could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be utilized to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.,GSE106540,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/01/24

Transcript-indexed ATAC-seq reveals paired single-cell T cell receptor identity and chromatin accessibility for precision immune profiling [single cell],T cells create vast amounts of diversity in their T cell receptor (TCR) genes__ enabling individual clones to recognize particular peptide-MHC ligands. Here we combine transposase accessible chromatin analysis and TCR sequencing (T-ATAC-seq) at the single-cell level. Using this approach__ we identify epigenomic signatures in immortalized leukemic T cells__ primary human T cells from healthy volunteers__ and primary leukemic T cells from clinical patient samples. In healthy peripheral blood CD4+ T cells__ we identify cis and trans regulators of naive and memory T cell states and find significant heterogeneity in surface marker-defined populations. In patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma__ we identify leukemic and non-leukemic regulatory pathways in cells from the same individual__ which has been previously challenging. Thus__ T-ATAC-seq is a new tool enabling analysis of epigenomic landscapes in clonal T cells and should be valuable for studies of T cell malignancy__ immunity__ and immunotherapy.,GSE107816,Homo sapiens,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,2018/01/15
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of human CD14+ monocytes,We performed single-cell RNA-seq on CD14+ monocytes isolated from the blood of healthy donors.

Multiplexing droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing using genetic barcodes,Here__ we introduce an in-silico algorithm demuxlet that harnesses naturally occurring genetic variation in a pool of cells from unrelated individuals to discover the sample identity of each cell and identify droplets containing cells from two different individuals (doublets). These two capabilities enable a simple multiplexing design that increases single cell library construction throughput by experimental design where cells from genetically diverse samples are multiplexed and captured at 2-10x over standard workflows. We further demonstrate the utility of sample multiplexing by characterizing the interindividual variability in cell type-specific responses of ~15k PBMCs to interferon-beta__ a potent cytokine. Our computational tool enables sample multiplexing of droplet-based single cell RNA-seq for large-scale studies of population variation and could be extended to other single cell datasets that incorporate natural or synthetic DNA barcodes.,GSE96583,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2017/06/13
Transcriptome profiles of human pre-DC and DC subsets in peripheral blood,Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. Important questions on the origins and differentiation paths of human DC populations remain elusive. Here we combined two high-dimensional technologies__ single-cell mRNA sequencing and mass cytometry to define and characterize CD33+CD45RA+ DC precursors (pre-DC) present in human blood. In this study__ we showed that a previously understimated pre-DC population shares surface markers with plasmacytoid DC (pDC)__ but has distinct functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Finally__ we trace the origin of DCs from BM to peripheral blood and reveal that pre-DC comprise three sub-populations - 1 uncommitted sub-population and 2 lineage-committed sub-populations. The discovery of committed pre-DC populations in present in human peripheral blood confirms the existence of DC as a distinct hematopoietic lineage and opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting.,GSE80171,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by array,2017/05/21
Mapping the human DC lineage through the integration of high dimensional techniques,Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. The human DC population comprises two main functionally-specialized lineages__ whose origins and differentiation pathways remain incompletely defined. Here we combine two high-dimensional technologies — single-cell mRNA sequencing and Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF)__ to identify human blood CD123+CD33+CD45RA+ DC precursors (pre-DC). Pre-DC share surface markers with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) but have distinct functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Tracing the differentiation of DC from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood revealed that the pre-DC compartment contains distinct lineage-committed sub-populations including one early uncommitted CD123high pre-DC subset and two CD45RA+CD123low lineage-committed subsets exhibiting functional differences. The discovery of multiple committed pre-DC populations opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting.,GSE98052,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,2017/05/01

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells__ monocytes and progenitors,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh blood using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Single-cell suspensions were stained with different antibody cocktails designed to enrich for particular immune cell populations__ which were then single cell sorted in 96-well plates. Single cell RNA-sequencing libraries were subsequently generated for 2422 single cells using Smart-Seq2 (Picelli et al.__ Nature Methods__ 2014).

A PBMC Transcriptional Module Related to Vascular Function,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)__ including rare circulating stem and progenitor cells (CSPCs)__ have important yet poorly understood roles in the maintenance and repair of blood vessels and perfused organs. Our hypothesis was that the identities and functions of CSPCs in cardiovascular health could be ascertained by analyzing the patterns of their co-expressed markers in unselected PBMC samples. Because gene microarrays had failed to detect many stem cell-associated genes__ we performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the expression of 45 primitive and tissue differentiation markers in PBMCs from healthy and hypertensive human subjects. We compared these expression levels to the subjects’ demographic and cardiovascular risk factors__ including vascular stiffness. The tested marker genes were expressed in all of samples and organized in hierarchical transcriptional network modules. An index of gene expression in one of these modules (metagene)__ defined as the average standardized relative copy numbers of 15 pluripotency and cardiovascular differentiation markers__ was negatively correlated (all p<0.03) with age (R2=-0.23)__ vascular stiffness (R2=-0.24)__ and central aortic pressure (R2=-0.19) and positively correlated with body mass index (R2=0.72__ in women). The co-expression of three neovascular markers was validated at the single-cell level using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The overall gene expression in this cardiovascular module was reduced by 72±22% in the patients compared with controls. However__ the compactness of both modules was increased in the patients’ samples__ which was reflected in reduced dispersion of their nodes’ degrees of connectivity__ suggesting a more primitive character of the patients’ CSPCs. In conclusion__ our results show that the relationship between CSPCs and vascular function is encoded in modules of the PBMCs transcriptional network. Furthermore__ the coordinated gene expression in these modules can be linked to cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease; thus__ this measure may be useful for their diagnosis and prognosis.,GSE56327,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by RT-PCR,2014/07/21
Induction of pluripotency in human somatic cells via a primitive streak-like state,During mammalian embryonic development__ the primitive streak is initiates the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells into germ layers. Pluripotency can be reacquired in committed somatic cells using a combination of handful transcription factors__ such as OCT3/4__ SOX2__ KLF4 and c-MYC (hereafter referred to as OSKM)__ albeit with low efficiency . Here we show that__ during the OSKM-induced reprogramming process toward pluripotency in human cells__ intermediate cells transiently show gene expression profiles resembling mesendoderm__ which is a major component of the primitive streak. Based on these findings__ we discover that forkhead box H1 (FOXH1)__ a transcription factor required for anterior primitive streak specification during early development__ significantly enhances the reprogramming efficiency of human fibroblasts by promoting their maturation__ including the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and the activation of late pluripotent markers. These results demonstrate that during the reprogramming process__ human somatic cells go through a transient state that resembles mesendoderm.,GSE50206,Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,Expression profiling by array,2014/04/24
Comparison of haploid and diploid clones of KBM7 cancer cell line,The series were performed to study the changes in gene expression upon diploidization of KBM7 cancer (CML) cell line. The line can exist either as a clone with 24 chromosomes (nearly haploid) or with 48 chromosomes (nearly diploid). Gene expression patterns are largely ploidy-independent__ as suggested by this experiment,GSE56465,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by array,2014/04/10
Analysis of gene expression response of CLL cells to co-culture with Nurse like cells,In the marrow and lymphatic tissues__ chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells interact with accessory cells that constitute the leukemia microenvironment. In lymphatic tissues__ CLL cells are interspersed with CD68+ nurselike cells (NLC) and T cells. However__ the mechanism regulating co-localization of CLL cells and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross-talk between CLL and NLC__ we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after co-culture with NLC. NLC co-culture induced high-level expression of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and two chemoattractants (CCL3__ CCL4) by CLL cells. Supernatants from CLL-NLC co-cultures revealed high CCL3/CCL4 protein levels. B cell receptor triggering also induced a robust induction of CCL3 and CCL4 expression by CLL cells__ which was almost completely abrogated by a specific Syc inhibitor__ R406. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that activation of this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross-talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment__ namely the secretion of two T cell chemokines by CLL-NLC interaction and in response to BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines__ CLL cells can recruit accessory cells__ and thereby actively create a microenvironment that favors their growth and survival.,GSE13811,Homo sapiens,Expression profiling by array,2008/12/11
Genetic alteration in recurrent melanoma,It is generally accepted that human cancers derive from a mutated single cell. However__ the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma__ we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with heterologous ones and correlated array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed on autologous cell lines and heterologous melanoma cell lines originated from other patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances__ global transcriptional patterns and cellular phenotypes; they did not follow a strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis; although their contribution was intertwined__ genomic imbalances detectable by aCGH contributed only 25% of the transcriptional traits determining autologous tumors distinctiveness. Our study provides important insights about the dynamics of cancer progression and supports the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies against stable genetic factors determining the individuality of each patient’s disease that are maintained throughout the end stage of disease.

Convergence of TCR and IL-7 pathways leads to FOXO3a phosphorylation and drives the survival of C. Memory CD4+ T cells,The molecular events that are involved in the establishment and the maintenance of CD4+ Central Memory (TCM) and Effector Memory (TEM) T cells are poorly understood. Using global gene expression profiling__ single cell proteomics__ and functional assays__ we show that the survival of TCM CD4+ T cells involves the activation and phosphorylation of STAT5a and FOXO3a. STAT5a phosphorylation induces the transcriptional up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes specifically in TCM. The phosphorylation of FOXO3a at S315__ following TCR engagement__ prevents the transcription of pro-apoptotic gene like FasL and BIM. Experiments aimed at blocking FOXO3a phosphorylation confirmed the role of FOXO3a in protecting TCM from apoptosis. Our results define the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the longevity and persistence of CD4+ TCM.
