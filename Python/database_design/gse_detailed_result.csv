GSE187438,Factors contributing to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy efficacy in pediatric oncology patients,,"Immune cell populations are composed of multiple cell types and their functions are tightly connected through their interactions. Cancer immunotherapy enhances the immune system’s ability to recognize and fight cancer and diminish cancer’s ability to evade the immune system. In Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, T-cells are engineered to eliminate cancer cells by targeting cell surface markers. Problems with CAR-T therapy include relapse due to loss of persistence of CAR-T cells and loss of CD19 expression on leukemia cells. The mechanisms of CAR-T failure need to be elucidated and exploring these mechanisms will identify potential treatment options and improve outcomes.Utilizing single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq), we investigated the interactions between CAR-T cells and the immune cells in pediatric ALL patients who’ve received CAR-T therapy. We analyzed the lymphocyte composition and gene expression profile at different time-points of ALL patients through CAR-T cell therapy. We have compared this data in responders with relapse patients after CAR-T infusion. Focusing on significantly altered immune cell populations and their gene markers, we  employ in vitro and in vivo models to validate their function.","PBMC or BMMC from the patients' blood or bone marrow were isloated by EasySep™ Direct Human PBMC Isolation Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.

GSE246456,Pathophysiology of androgen-associated endothelial cell dysfunction in phenotype A polycystic ovarian syndrome revealed by iPSCs modeling,,"Abundant evidence suggests that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased metabolic aberrations and cardiovascular risks and present with signs of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. However, whether and how androgen is involved in the pathogenesis of EC dysfunction in PCOS remains unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were established in two PCOS patients and two control participants and further differentiated into ECs via monoculture under chemically defined conditions. Both PCOS patients were phenotype A (present with oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology) and were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the iPSC-derived ECs revealed functional differences involving the cell cycle process, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and apoptosis between the PCOS and control groups. Decreased expression of cell proliferation and cell cycle related genes were noted in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment significantly enhanced cell proliferation and angiogenic function in the control iPSC-derived ECs. In contrast, significantly deteriorated cell proliferation accompanied with diminished expression of androgen receptor/cyclin-dependent kinase 1/VEGF signaling pathway was shown in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs after DHT treatment, alongside with impaired angiogenesis demonstrated by the tube formation and wound healing assay. In conclusion, disease-specific iPSCs were successfully established in phenotype A PCOS patients with metabolic syndrome and served as an effective platform for disease modeling in this specific subgroup. Both intrinsic and androgen-induced cellular proliferation and angiogenesis were significantly impaired in the PCOS iPSC-derived ECs, providing new pathogenic evidence for androgen-mediated EC dysfunction and possibly further cardiovascular consequences.",single-cell RNA-seq,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Wu CE;Ho HN,National Taiwan University Hospital,Taiwan,GSM7869173;GSM7869174;GSM7869175;GSM7869176,"Nov 01, 2023","Oct 27, 2023","Nov 01, 2023"
GSE233315,Immune landscape of PBMC based on single-cell rna sequancing in End Stage Renal Disease,,"Although an increase in studies has revealed the potential mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction during CKD progression, there are still many significant components that need to be clarified, such as the machinery of T-cell phenotype switching and the plasticity levels of different subsets. Fortunately, in the last decade, novel technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled us to investigate transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell level and have enabled us to unravel the potential mechanisms of the heterogeneity of the cell phenotype underlying different diseases. In this study, we investigated the immune cell composition, function, and interaction with other cells in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) during the ESRD period, especially CD4+ T-cell plasticity and the involved signaling pathways and mediators, which could be potential therapeutic targets for preventing CKD progression and complications.","In this case‒control study, 14 male and 6 female ESRD patients who underwent standard hemodialysis were enrolled. Twenty healthy volunteers who were sex- and age-matched to ESRD patients comprised the healthy control group. All the participants were involved between June 1, 2022, and September 1, 2022. ESRD patients were required to meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: ESRD patients receiving standard hemodialysis (HD) with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for 5-10 years; the cause of kidney damage was primary kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy; and the discontinuation of corticosteroid and immunosuppression therapy for at least 1 year. Exclusion criteria: infection, tumor (including parenchymal tumor and hematological system tumor), autoimmune disease, acute infection, and other diseases; vaccination for COVID-19, influenza, and other viruses in the past 3 months; and an unwillingness or inability to cooperate due to individual reasons. Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation was applied for PBMC isolation. Dead cells were removed using a Miltenyi ® Dead Cell Removal Kit (MACS, 130-090-101). Cell suspensions were resuspended in 1× PBS buffer with 0.04% BSA and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C (repeated twice). The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 1× PBS buffer with 0.04% BSA. The overall cell viability was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Cell viability above 85% was required for scRNA sequencing using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter. The PBMCs were diluted to a concentration of 1*106 cells/mL with sorting buffer.

GSE233276,Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with active idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) and healthy controls (HC) [RTXrel_vs_RTXrem],,"An autoimmune B cell origin for childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is predicted based on the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) at maintaining long-term remission from proteinuria. Knowledge regarding the nature of the culprit B cell response is very limited. In particular, no transcriptomics work has been performed to evaluate the B cell response in INS. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on B cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from four children with INS during the B cell recovery phase of a previous RTX treamtent while in remission or relapse (paired relapse-remisison samples). We show that the post-RTX B cell landscape is overwhelmingly antigen-inexperienced with minimal transcriptomic differences between relapse and remission. However, post-RTX relapses were associated with an early resurgence of an extrafollicular B cell population expressing genes associated with marginal zone B cells (MZB1, CD24, IGHM, CD1C, TNFRSF13B, GPR183). Together, our study provides evidence for an extrafollicular origin for humoral immunity in active INS.",PBMC were isolated from the blood of four children with INS during the B cell recovery phase of previous RTX treatments during relapse and remission.

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from four affected children with active INS and four age/sex-matched health controls (HC), we demonstrate that a B cell transcriptional program poised for effector functions represents the major immune perturbation in the blood of children with active INS. We show that this nephrotic B cell signature is conferred by the engagement of memory B cells through an extrafollicular developmental route defined by expression of the interfollicular-homing gene GPR183 and the expansion of atypical B cells and marginal zone-like B cells. Moreover, we show that genes involved in APRIL signaling, which promotes extrafollicular antibody-secreting cell development, were substantially upregulated in B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells from INS children.

GSE237254,Early-to-mid stage idiopathic Parkinson’s disease shows enhanced cytotoxicity and differentiation in CD8 T-cells in females,,"Neuroinflammation in the brain contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the potential dysregulation of peripheral immunity has not been systematically investigated for idiopathic PD (iPD). Here we showed an elevated peripheral cytotoxic immune milieu, with more terminally-differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) CD8 T, CD8+ NKT cells and circulating cytotoxic molecules in fresh blood of early-to-mid iPD, especially in females, after analyzing >700 innate and adaptive features. This profile, also reflected by fewer CD8+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, was confirmed in another subcohort. Co-expression between cytotoxic molecules was selectively enhanced in CD8 TEMRA and effector memory (TEM) cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated the accelerated CD8 differentiation within CD8 compartments, enhanced cytotoxic pathways in CD8 TEMRA and TEM cells, while CD8 central-memory (TCM) and naïve cells were already more-active and transcriptionally-reprogrammed. Our work provides a comprehensive map of dysregulated peripheral immunity in iPD, proposing previously-unrecognized candidates for early diagnosis and treatments.","We compared samples between patients with early-to-mid idiopathic Parkinson’s diseases (iPD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Four HC were 59-65 years old (mean=62.33) while five iPD were 56-68 years old (mean=63.14) when they were sampled. Considering our female-biased data in clinical diagnostic values, we only selected female iPD vs age-matched HC for scRNA-seq. All the iPD and HC are CMV seropositive (for other inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to the manuscript). All the iPD have a Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging scale of 2.

GSE237579,Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Conjunction with TLR Agonist Polarizes Interferon Immune Responses Associated with Long-term Survival in Malignant Glioma Patients [scRNA-seq],37790490,"Autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell (ATL-DC) vaccination is a promising immunotherapy for patients with high grade gliomas, but responses have not been demonstrated in all patients. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can enhance the anti-tumor immune response from cancer vaccines.  To determine the most effective combination of autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination, with or without the adjuvant toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists poly-ICLC or resiquimod, we conducted a randomized, open-label multi-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival in 23 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent WHO Grade III-IV malignant gliomas. Patients were randomized to receive ATL-DC vaccination with either a placebo, a TLR-7/8 agonist (resiquimod, topical 0.2%), or a TLR-3 agonist (poly-ICLC, 20 mcg/kg intramuscular).  Peripheral blood was obtained at baseline and following the vaccination cycle for immune monitoring. Mass cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses were performed. Analysis of the bulk RNAseq data (pre-treatment vs. post-treatment) demonstrated highly significant upregulation of type 1 and type 2 interferon gene expression selectively in patients who received adjuvant TLR agonist (either poly-ICLC or resiquimod) together with ATL-DC.  CyTOF analysis of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed increased levels of memory PD-1+ T-cell and monocyte populations after ATL-DC + TLR agonist administration.  In addition, scRNA-seq demonstrated a higher expression fold change of IFN-induced genes with poly-ICLC treatment in both peripheral blood monocytes and T lymphocytes. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.1 months (5.5 placebo vs. 8.1 resiquimod vs. 31.4 poly-ICLC), and median overall survival (OS) was 26.6 months (7.7 placebo vs. 16.7 resiquimod vs. 52.5 poly-ICLC).   Patients who had higher expression of interferon response genes lived significantly longer and had longer time to progression compared to those with lower expression.  The results suggest that ATL-DC in conjunction with adjuvant poly-ICLCTL induces a polarized interferon response in circulating monocytes and specific activation of a CD8+ T cell population. This combination was associated with extended survival in this patient population. This interferon response signature may represent an important blood biomarker for immunotherapy in patients with malignant glioma.","The cells for scRNAseq analysis were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1,000 cells/µl.

We used a multi-omics approach to uncover ancestry-specific immune alterations in SLE patients and healthy controls that may contribute to disease disparities. Cell composition, signaling, and epigenetics were evaluated by mass cytometry; droplet-based single cell transcriptomics and paired proteogenomics (scRNA-Seq/scCITE-Seq).  Soluble mediator levels were measured in plasma and stimulated whole blood. TLR3/4/7/8/9 gene expression pathways in B cells and monocytes were enhanced in AA SLE patients compared to EA patients. TLR7/8/9 and IFN phospho-signaling responses were also heightened in healthy AA versus EA controls. Exposure of AA and EA healthy control cells to TLR7/8/9 agonists or IFN resulted in altered immune cell compositions that recapitulated the ancestry-associated differences in SLE patients.

Vitamin D treatment has emerged as potentially protective, even though results from randomized controlled trials are conflicting. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) coupled with barcoded antibodies targeting surface markers (CITE-seq) to discover candidate genes and pathways regulated in PBMC subpopulations from MS patients treated with high-dose vitamin D (n=5) or placebo (n=5). Best candidates were combined with genes involved in immune function and vitamin D metabolism for validation in a new cohort (n=8 in each group) by high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) in naive CD4, Th1, Th17, Treg, naive CD8, memory and naive B cells, and MAIT cells, sorted by FACS. CITE-seq showed no significant changes in the proportions of these subpopulations in vitamin D-treated patients. Of the 92 candidate genes revealed by CITE-seq, differential expression of five genes (UXT, SNRPN, SUB1, GNLY and KLF6) was validated by HT-qPCR.

Here we demonstrate that IL-15 is a critical CTCL growth and survival factor. Importantly, a genetically engineered immunodeficient mouse model expressing human IL-15 uniquely supported the growth of patient derived Sezary cells relative to conventional immunodeficient mouse strains. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) SS models recapacitated the pathologic features of the human disease, including skin infiltration and spread of leukemic cells to the periphery, and maintained the dependence on human IL-15 upon serial in vivo passaging. Detailed molecular characterization of the engrafted cells by single cell transcriptome analysis revealed tissue specific regulation of gene expression and distinct clonal engraftment patterns. Overall, we document an important dependence of Sezary cell survival and proliferation on IL-15 signaling and the utility of the humanized IL-15, immunodeficient mice for SS PDX model generation. Furthermore, these studies advocate for the thorough molecular understanding of the resultant PDX models to maximize their translational impact.","Data inludes 1 primary Sezary syndrome patient PBMC, 1 healthy donor PBMC.

GSE232002,Multiomic Single Cell Evaluation Reveals Inflammatory Cytokines Affect Innate Lymphoid Cell Fate After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation [scATAC-Seq],,"Type II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) maintain homeostasis and barrier integrity in mucosal tissues. Previous work has shown that in mice and humans, ILC2s fail to reconstitute after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Determining the mechanisms involved in their impaired reconstitution could improve transplant outcomes. By integrating chromatin and transcriptomic analysis of marked, transplanted ILC2s at the single cell level, we identify a previously unreported population of converted ILC1-like cells in the small intestine post-transplant. Exposure of ILC2s to proinflammatory cytokines in vitro results in a mixed ILC1-ILC2 phenotype but was able to convert only an extremely small population of ILC2s to ILC1s as observed in vivo. Whereas ILC2s protected against acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) mediated-morbidity and mortality, infusion of proinflammatory cytokine-exposed ILC2s accelerated aGvHD. Finally, circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with aGvHD have an altered ILC2-associated chromatin landscape compared to transplanted controls. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that ILC2s fail to repopulate their protective niche after allo-HSCT in part due to conversion to a pro-pathogenic population marked by an ILC1-like chromatin state, providing novel insights into the contribution of ILC plasticity to aGvHD pathogenesis after allo-HSCT.","Adults receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations consented to have blood-derived PBMCs biobanked under Duke University IRB study protocol Pro00110250. We requested samples from 3-6 patients after alloHSCT with a diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease and 3-6 that were stable. Additionally, we requested a pre-HSCT sample and then one drawn as close as possible to the time of the aGVHD diagnosis, as well as 3 months and 1 year where available.

GSE212479,Single-cell multi-omics sequencing reveals the functional regulatory landscape of STAT3-V637M Hyper-IgE syndrome,37480751,"Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by, among others, the excessive production of IgE and repetitive bacterial/fungal infections. Although STAT3 is a known causative factor of HIES, the biological consequences of STAT3 mutation are not completely understood, especially at the epigenetic level. Here, we used multi-omic approaches to decipher the multidimensional immune disturbance in a male HIES patient harboring STAT3-V637M. In his peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) we found significant clonal expansion of CD8 T cells (whose expression of CD8 subunits was increased, resulting in enhanced responsiveness to MHC I molecules), but not CD4 T cells and B cells in his. The lack of T cells-B cells interaction could be responsible for the limited number of his B cells, although they exhibited a higher potential in producing immunoglobulin, elevated SPIC binding might bias this process toward IgE isotype production. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including CTLA4, LAG3, were overexpressed in his PBMC-CD4 T cells, accompanied by reduced CD28 and IL6ST (gp130) expression. For his CD4 T cells, integrative analyses predicted upstream transcription factors (ETV6, KLF13, and RORA) for LAG3, IL6ST, and CD28, respectively. The down-regulated phagocytic, and nitric oxide synthetic genes in his PBMC-monocytes seem to be the culprit of his disseminated bacterial/fungal infection. In his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), we identified two macrophages with anti-bacterial properties, which were characterized by CXCL8/S100A8/S100A9, or SOD2, respectively. Together, this study comprehensively described how the immune cell landscape was disturbed in STAT3-V637M HIES and provided a resource for further studies on STAT3 biology.","We collected PBMC and BALF from an 18-year-old male harboring STAT3-V637M. Paired PBMC and BALF samples collected from the patient were subjected to GEX/V(D)J-seq and scRNA-seq according to the manufacturer’s protocol, respectively.

GSE242477,Comprehensive single-cell immune profiling of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes in acral lentiginous melanoma with therapeutic implications.,,"Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most common melanoma subtype in non-Caucasians. Despite significant advances in cancer immunotherapy, current immune checkpoint inhibitors remain unsatisfactory for ALM. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive immune profiling using single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis, along with the reactivity screening of TCRs of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) in ALM. We identified tumor-reactive CD8 T cell populations, primarily exhibiting an exhausted state, within multiple phenotypic subsets of TILs in ALM. In comparison to cutaneous melanoma, clusters with tumor-reactive phenotype presented a lower abundance, and enrichment of Treg cells were observed, suggesting suppressive immune microenvironment of ALM. We found a heterogeneous expression of co-inhibitory molecules in tumor-reactive CD8 TILs, with a subpopulation of activated T cells that was rich in genes related to cytotoxicity and marked by the expression of KLRC1 (NKG2A), a suppressive co-inhibitory molecule with therapeutic implications. Overall, our study provides a foundation for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in ALM.","Single-cell immune profiling of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from primary and metastatic human acral lentiginous melanoma was conducted.

GSE228078,Single cell transcriptomic atlas of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells reveals a distinct cytotoxic-like subset in HIV-1 infected individuals.,37664600,"To understand how the transcriptome of pDCs is impacted by HIV-1 infection and exogenous stimulation, we sorted pDCs from people with HIV-1 (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment before and after toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist treatment, as well as from healthy controls, and performed single-cell (sc)-RNA sequencing. We generated a transcriptomic atlas of over 112,000 pDCs. Our cluster analysis revealed an inducible cytotoxic-like pDC cluster characterized by high expression of both antiviral and cytotoxic genes. We further reported that this cytotoxic-like pDC cluster is distinct from NK and T cells. This observation was further supported by our cell-cell communication analysis revealing that cytotoxic-like pDCs exhibit similar incoming and outgoing cellular communicating signals as other pDCs. In addition to the cytotoxic-like pDC cluster, we also characterized two homogenous pDC clusters (pDC1 and pDC2) and an exhausted pDC cluster. In conclusion, our findings provide a comprehensive pDC transcriptomic atlas and open a new scope on the mechanisms of regulation and function of cytotoxic-like pDCs in HIV and other infections.","we sorted pDCs from people with HIV-1 (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment before and after toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist treatment, as well as from healthy controls, and performed single-cell (sc)-RNA sequencing",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Cham LB;Sogaard OS,004552697244,Denmark,GSM7113581;GSM7113582;GSM7113583;GSM7113584;GSM7113585;GSM7113586;GSM7113587;GSM7113588;GSM7113589;GSM7113590;GSM7113591;GSM7113592,"Sep 05, 2023","Mar 23, 2023","Sep 06, 2023"
GSE242127,A Hub Gene Signature as a Therapeutic Target and Biomarker for Sepsis and Geriatric Sepsis-Induced ARDS Concomitant with COVID-19 Infection,37822934,"Background: COVID-19 and sepsis represent formidable public health challenges, characterized by incompletely elucidated molecular mechanisms. Elucidating the interplay between COVID-19 and sepsis, particularly in geriatric patients suffering from sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is of paramount importance for identifying potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate hospitalization and mortality risks.We employed bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to identify hub genes, shared pathways, molecular biomarkers, and candidate therapeutics for managing COVID-19, sepsis, and sepsis-induced ARDS. We corroborated these hub genes utilizing murine sepsis-ARDS models and blood samples derived from geriatric patients afflicted by sepsis-induced ARDS.Results: Our investigation revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared among COVID-19 and sepsis datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network, unearthing pivotal hub genes and modules. Notably, nine hub genes displayed significant alterations and correlations with critical inflammatory mediators of pulmonary injury in murine septic lungs. Simultaneously, 12 displayed significant changes and correlations with a neutrophil-recruiting chemokine in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. Of these, six hub genes (CD247, CD2, CD40LG, KLRB1, LCN2, RETN) showed significant alterations across COVID-19, sepsis, and geriatric sepsis-induced ARDS. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of hub genes across 3 diverse immune cell types furnished insights into disease pathogenesis. Functional analysis underscored the interconnection between sepsis/sepsis-ARDS and COVID-19, enabling us to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets, transcription factor-gene interactions, DEG-microRNA co-regulatory networks, and prospective drug and chemical compound interactions involving hub genes.Our investigation offers potential therapeutic targets/biomarkers, sheds light on the immune response in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS, emphasizes the association between sepsis/sepsis-ARDS and COVID-19, and proposes novel avenues for targeted therapies.","On the first and seventh days of admission, we obtained blood samples from three patients with sepsis-ARDS, as well as PBMC single-cell sequencing.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Qian G;Fang H;Chen A;Sun Z;Huang M;Luo M;Cheng E;Zhang S;Wang X;Fang H,Guangzhou Medical University Cancer Hospital,China,GSM7749422;GSM7749423;GSM7749424;GSM7749425;GSM7749426;GSM7749427,"Sep 01, 2023","Sep 01, 2023","Oct 18, 2023"

GSE235857,Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals immune cell heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukaemia peripheral blood mononuclear cells after chemotherapy,37615858,"Purpose Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the rapid clonal expansion of abnormally differentiated myeloid progenitor cells residing in a complex microenvironment. However, the immune cell types, status, and genome profile of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) microenvironment in AML patients after chemotherapy are poorly understood. In order to explore the immune microenvironment of AML patients after chemotherapy, we conducted this study for providing insights into precision medicine and immunotherapy of AML. Methods In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse the PBMC microenvironment from five AML patients treated with different chemotherapy regimens and six healthy donors. We compared the cell compositions in AML patients and healthy donors, and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), CellPhoneDB, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. Results Using scRNA-seq technology, 91,772 high quality cells of 44,950 PBMCs from AML patients and 46,822 PBMCs from healthy donors were classified as 14 major cell clusters. Our study revealed the sub-cluster diversity of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and haematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC-Prog) in AML patients under chemotherapy. NK cells and monocyte-DCs showed significant changes in transcription factor expression and chromosome copy number variation (CNV). We also observed significant heterogeneity in CNV and intercellular interaction networks in HSC-Prog cells. Conclusion Our results elucidated the PBMC single-cell landscape and provided insights into precision medicine and immunotherapy for treating AML.","scRNA-seq to analyse the PBMC microenvironment from five AML patients (AML1, AML2, AML3, AML3B, AML4, AML5) treated with different chemotherapy regimens and six healthy donors(H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7).-----------------Authors state:Raw files were not submitted due to patient privacy concerns",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Hu X;Cao D;Zhou Z,Shenzhen Center for Chronic Disease Control and Prevention,China,GSM7510825;GSM7510826;GSM7510827;GSM7510828;GSM7510829;GSM7510830;GSM7510831;GSM7510832;GSM7510833;GSM7510834;GSM7510835;GSM7510836,"Aug 31, 2023","Jun 26, 2023","Sep 01, 2023"

GSE214546,Tri-modal Single Cell Approach Reveals Cellular and Molecular Heterogeneity in Naïve T cells Across Human Age,37845489,"The naïve T cell compartment undergoes multiple changes across age that associate with altered susceptibility to infection and autoimmunity. In addition to the acquisition of naïve-like memory T cell subsets, recent murine studies describe substantial molecular reprogramming of the naïve compartment in adults compared with adolescents. However, these alterations are not well delineated in human aging. Using a new trimodal single cell technology (TEA-seq), we discovered that the composition as well as the transcriptional and epigenetic programming of the naïve T cell compartment in children (11-13 yrs) is distinct from that of older adults (55-65 yrs). Naive CD4 T cells, previously considered relatively resistant to aging, exhibited far more pronounced molecular reprogramming than the CD8 compartment, in which alterations are preferentially driven by shifts in naive-like memory subsets. These data reveal the complex nature of the naïve T cell compartment that may contribute to differential immune responses across the spectrum of human age. ","scRNAseq was performed on 48 samples.

Traditional multimer and other single cell assays often require large blood volumes and/or expensive HLA-specific reagents and provide limited phenotypic and functional information. Here, we present the Rapid TCR:Epitope Ranker (RAPTER) assay, a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-SEQ) method that uses primary human T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) to assess functional T cell reactivity at single cell resolution. Using hash-tag oligonucleotide (HTO) coding and T cell activation-induced markers (AIM), RAPTER defines paired epitope specificity and TCR sequence and can include RNA- and protein-level T cell phenotype information.  We demonstrate that RAPTER identified specific reactivities to viral and tumor antigens at sensitivities as low as 0.15% of total CD8+ T cells, and deconvoluted low-frequency circulating HPV16-specific T cell clones from a cervical cancer patient. The specificities of TCRs identified by RAPTER for MART1, EBV, and influenza epitopes were functionally confirmed in vitro. In summary, RAPTER identifies low-frequency T cell reactivities using primary cells from low blood volumes, and the resulting paired TCR: ligand information can directly enable immunogenic antigen selection for vaccine epitope inclusion, antigen-specific TCR tracking, and TCR cloning for further therapeutic development.",Human PBMCs were put through the RAPTER assay described in the manuscript then measured via scRNAseq,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Deering RP;Blumenberg L;Li L;Dhanik A;Jeong S;Pourpe S;Song H;Boucher L;Ragunathan S;Li Y;Zhong M;Kuhnert J;Adler C;Hawins P;Gupta NT;Moore M;Ni M;Hansen J;Wei Y;Thurston G,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,USA,GSM7306830;GSM7306831;GSM7306832;GSM7306833;GSM7306834;GSM7306835;GSM7306836;GSM7306837;GSM7306838;GSM7306839;GSM7306840;GSM7306841;GSM7306842;GSM7306843;GSM7306844;GSM7306845;GSM7306846;GSM7306847;GSM7306848;GSM7306849;GSM7306850;GSM7306851;GSM7306852;GSM7306853;GSM7306854;GSM7306855;GSM7306856;GSM7306857;GSM7306858;GSM7306859;GSM7306860;GSM7306861;GSM7306862;GSM7306863;GSM7306864;GSM7306865;GSM7306866;GSM7306867;GSM7306868;GSM7306869;GSM7306870;GSM7306871;GSM7306872;GSM7306873;GSM7306874;GSM7306875;GSM7306876;GSM7306877;GSM7306878;GSM7306879;GSM7306880;GSM7306881,"Aug 25, 2023","May 08, 2023","Aug 26, 2023"

Lastly, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical parameters related to immunity and metabolism of the convalescents. We found that major organs exhibited ephemeral dysfunction in double-Convidecia vaccinated persons who experienced BA.2 BTI and recovered to normal in approximately six-month. We observed durable and potent levels of neutralizing antibodies against major circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sub-variants, including BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and BF.7, indicating that hybrid humoral immunity stays active. However, PLTs may take longer to recover. This was supported by proteomic and scRNA-seq analyses, which also showed coagulation disorder and an imbalance between anti-pathogen immunity and metabolism six-month after BA.2 BTI. The immunity-metabolism imbalance was then proved with retrospective analysis of abnormal levels of hormones, low blood glucose level and coagulation profile. The long-term malfunctional coagulation and imbalance in the material metabolism and immunity may contribute to the development of long COVID and act as useful indicators for assessing recovery and the long-term impacts after Omicron sub-variant BTIs.","We did single-cell RNA sequencing on 9 human samples, including 5 BA.2 breakthrough infected convalescents and 4 healthy people.>>>Raw data for human samples have been submitted to China's Genome Sequence Archive (GSA, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/) with accession number HRA004484<<<",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Gao GF;Li Y;Qin S;Dong L,"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",China,GSM7707592;GSM7707593;GSM7707594;GSM7707595;GSM7707596;GSM7707597;GSM7707598;GSM7707599;GSM7707600,"Aug 16, 2023","Aug 11, 2023","Aug 16, 2023"
GSE204845,Single-cell multi-omics defines the cell-type specific impact of splicing aberrations in human hematopoietic clonal outgrowths,37582363,"RNA splicing factors are recurrently affected by alteration-of-function mutations in clonal blood disorders, highlighting the importance of splicing regulation in hematopoiesis. However, our understanding of the impact of dysregulated RNA splicing has been hampered by the inability to distinguish mutant and wildtype cells in primary patient samples, the cell-type complexity of the hematopoietic system, and the sparse coverage of splice junctions by short-read sequencing typically used in single-cell RNA sequencing. To overcome these limitations, we developed GoT-Splice by integrating Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) with enhanced efficiency long-read single-cell transcriptome profiling, as well as proteogenomics (with CITE-seq). This allowed for the simultaneous single-cell profiling of gene expression, cell surface protein markers, somatic mutation status, and RNA splicing. We applied GoT-Splice to bone marrow progenitors from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) affected by mutations in the most prevalent mutated RNA splicing factor – the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1. High-resolution mapping of SF3B1mut vs. SF3B1wt hematopoietic progenitors revealed increased fitness advantage of SF3B1mut cells in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, resulting in an expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor (EP) cells. SF3B1mut EP cells exhibited upregulation of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and mRNA translation. Long-read single-cell transcriptomes revealed the previously reported increase of aberrant 3’ splicing site usage in SF3B1mut cells. However, the ability to profile splicing within individual cell populations uncovered distinct cryptic 3’ splice site usage across different progenitor populations, as well as stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid maturation. Lastly, as splice factor mutations occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with increased risk of neoplastic transformation, we applied GoT-Splice to CH samples. These data revealed that the erythroid lineage bias, as well as cell-type specific cryptic 3’ splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells, precede overt MDS. Collectively, we present an expanded multi-omics single-cell toolkit to define the cell-type specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from the earliest phases of clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.","We profiled CD34+ enriched cells from GCSF mobilized bone marrow/stem cell graft samples (n = 11) using  single-cell RNA sequencing (10X and ONT) with targeted genotyping and ADT profiling of cell surface markers (for 2 samples, one with 2 replicates).Submitter states: The dataset contains human patient samples which are on submission process in EGA.",Other<br/>Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Gaiti F;Chamely P;Hawkins AG;Cortés-López M;Stanley RF;Swett AD;Ganesan S;Mouhieddine TH;Batta K;Furer N;Vedula RS;Chaligné R;Wiseman DH;Tanay A;Shlush L;Lindsley RC;Ghobrial I;Taylor J;Abdel-Wahab O;Landau DA,New York Genome Center,USA,GSM6198713;GSM6198714;GSM6198715;GSM6198716;GSM6198717;GSM6198718;GSM6198719;GSM6198720;GSM6198721;GSM6198722;GSM6198723;GSM6198724;GSM6198725;GSM6198726;GSM6198727;GSM6198728;GSM6198729;GSM6198730;GSM6198731;GSM6198732;GSM6198733;GSM6198734;GSM6198735;GSM6198736;GSM7703566;GSM7703573;GSM7703578;GSM7703583;GSM7703588;GSM7703591;GSM7703597;GSM7703602;GSM7703609;GSM7703612;GSM7703614;GSM7703617;GSM7703619;GSM7703620;GSM7703621,"Aug 14, 2023","May 25, 2022","Nov 02, 2023"
GSE231590,Identification of cow milk epitopes to characterize and quantify disease-specific T cells in allergic children,,"Cow milk (CM) allergy is the most prevalent food allergy in young children in the US and Great Britain. Current diagnostic tests are either unreliable (IgE, skin prick test), or resource-intensive with risks (food challenges). Here we set out to determine if allergen-specific T cells in cow milk allergic (CMA) patients have a distinct quality and/or quantity that could potentially be used as a diagnostic marker. Starting from cow milk extract, we mapped T cell responses to a set of reactive epitopes that we compiled in a peptide pool. This pool induced cytokine responses in in vitro cultured cells distinguishing allergic from non-allergic subjects. Using single-cell RNA and paired TCR sequencing we detected significant changes in the transcriptional program and clonality of cow milk antigen-specific (CM+) T cells elicited by the pool in allergic vs. non-allergic subjects ex vivo. CM+ T cells from allergic subjects had increased percentages of FOXP3+ over FOXP3- cells. FOXP3+ cells are often equated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have suppressive activity, but CM+ FOXP3+ cells from allergic subjects showed significant expression of interferon-responsive genes and dysregulated chemokine receptor expression compared to non-allergic subjects, suggesting that these are not conventional Tregs. The CM+ FOXP3+ cells were also more clonally expanded than the FOXP3- population. We were further able to utilize surface markers (CD25, CD127, CCR7) in combination with our peptide pool stimulation to quantify these CM+ FOXP3+ cells by a simple flow cytometry assay. We show increased percentages of CM+ CD127-CD25+ cells from CMA subjects in an independent cohort, which could be used for diagnostic purposes. Looking specifically for Th2 cells normally associated with allergic diseases, we found a small population of clonally expanded CM+ cells that were significantly increased in CMA subjects and that had high expression of Th2 cytokines and pathogenic Th2/Tfh markers. Overall, these findings suggest that there are several differences in the phenotype of CM+ T cells with CM allergy and that the increase in CM+ FOXP3+ cells is a potential diagnostic marker of an allergic state. Such markers have promising applications in monitoring natural disease outgrowth and/or the efficacy of immunotherapy that will need to be validated in future studies.","Antigen,specific,CD4,memory,T,cells,from,cow,milk,allergic,and,non-allergic,children,analyzed,by,scRNA/TCR-Seq---------------------------------------Authors state:The data in this study came from Human samples, who did not approve public sharing of their sequencing data.

GSE210063,Latent human herpesvirus 6 is reactivated in chimeric antigen receptor T cells,,"Cell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects of treatment, including neurotoxicity. Currently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity observed in patients receiving cell therapies, including encephalitis caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) that has been repeatedly reported. Here, via comprehensive viral RNA data mining, we examine the landscape of human latent viral reactivation, revealing that HHV-6B can become reactivated in human CD4+ T cells in standard in vitro cultures. Using single-cell sequencing, we identify a rare population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10,000 cells) that possess high viral transcriptional activity in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture before spreading rapidly to infect other cells in vitro. Through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products, we identify the presence of CAR+, HHV-6 super-expressor T cells in human patients in vivo. Together, our study implicates cell therapy products as the source of lytic HHV-6 repeatedly reported in clinical trialsand has broad implications for the design, screening, and interpretation of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies.",In vitro T cells were stimulated with aCD3/aCD28 beads and cultured in IL2 over time before single-cell genomics were performed,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Lareau C;Yin E;Satpathy A,Memorial Sloan Kettering,USA,GSM6416022;GSM6416023;GSM6416024;GSM6416025;GSM6416026;GSM6416027;GSM6416028;GSM6416029;GSM6416030;GSM6416031;GSM6416032;GSM6416033;GSM6416034;GSM6416035;GSM7498848;GSM7498849;GSM7498850;GSM7498851,"Aug 05, 2023","Jul 29, 2022","Aug 07, 2023"
GSE239750,Integrated BATF transcriptional network regulates suppressive intratumoral regulatory T cells,,"Human regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial regulators of tissue repair, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. However, it is challenging to inhibit the suppressive function of Tregs for cancer therapy, without impacting immune homeostasis. Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important, yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression, and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues, remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), in non-tumor tonsil tissues and in peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with non-tumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically, the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping and in vitro functional assays, corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs. Finally, we identified a suite of surface molecules reflective of the BATF-driven transcriptional network on intratumoral Tregs in patients with HNSCC. These findings uncover a primary transcriptional regulator of highly suppressive intratumoral Tregs, highlighting potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer without impacting immune homeostasis.","We leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to provide a detailed view on the heterogeneity of Tregs in the TME by profiling CD4+ T cells from tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken from patients with HNSCC, and comparing them to CD4+ T cells isolated from inflamed tonsil tissues from patients with tonsilitis, and from non-inflamed tonsil tissues from patients with sleep apnea and to healthy donor (HD) PBMC.

We profiled immune cells in glioma microenvironment and the matched peripheral blood from 11 patients at a single-cell level. Notably, glioblastoma exhibits specific infiltration of certain blood-originated monocytes expressing EGFR ligands including EREG and AREG, coined as tumor-associated monocytes (TAMo). TAMo infiltration is mutually exclusive with EGFR alterations (P = 0.019), while co-occurring with mesenchymal subtype (P = 4.7x10-7) and marking worse prognosis (P = 0.004 and 0.032 in two independent cohorts). Evolutionary analysis of initial-recurrent glioma pairs and single-cell study of a multi-centric glioblastoma reveals remarkable association between elevated TAMo and glioma mesenchymal transformation. Further analysis identifies FOSL2 as a master regulator of TAMo. The roles of FOSL2-EREG/AREG-EGFR signaling axis in promoting glioma invasion were verified experimentally.

Using single-cell RNA/TCR-sequencing, clonotypes were tracked from baseline tumors to ACT products (ACTP) and post-ACT blood and tumor samples from 13 metastatic melanoma patients (NCT03475134). Furthermore, a predictor of tumor-reactive clonotypes was derived from the transcriptomic profiles of tumor-specific or bystander clones. Patients with clinical responses had tumors enriched in tumor-reactive TILs, preferentially expanding in-vitro to generate larger and more tumoricidal products and preferentially re-infiltrating tumors post-ACT. Conversely, lack of responses was associated with tumors devoid of tumor-reactive clonotypes and with cell products mostly composed of blood-borne clonotypes. The exhaustion state characterizing intratumoral tumor-reactive TILs was attenuated during in-vitro expansion and restored after tumor re-engraftment only in responders. Thus, tumor-reactive clonotypes drive clinical response to TIL therapy, providing insight to select patients or improve TILs’ culture.","Bulk TCR repertoire of longitudinal blood, tumor and expanded TIL products of melanoma patients receiving TIL-ACT.",Other,Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens),Chiffelle J;Genolet R;Harari A;Coukos G,Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois,Switzerland,GSM7465525;GSM7465526;GSM7465527;GSM7465528;GSM7465529;GSM7465530;GSM7465531;GSM7465532;GSM7465533;GSM7465534;GSM7465535;GSM7465536;GSM7465537;GSM7465538;GSM7465539;GSM7465540;GSM7465541;GSM7465542;GSM7465543;GSM7465544;GSM7465545;GSM7465546;GSM7465547;GSM7465548;GSM7465549;GSM7465550;GSM7465551;GSM7465552;GSM7465553;GSM7465554;GSM7465555;GSM7465556;GSM7465557;GSM7465558;GSM7465559;GSM7465560;GSM7465561;GSM7465562;GSM7465563;GSM7465564;GSM7465565;GSM7465566;GSM7465567;GSM7465568;GSM7465569;GSM7465570;GSM7465571;GSM7465572;GSM7465573;GSM7465574;GSM7465575;GSM7465576;GSM7465577;GSM7465578;GSM7465579;GSM7465580;GSM7465581;GSM7465582;GSM7465583;GSM7465584;GSM7465585;GSM7465586;GSM7465587,"Aug 01, 2023","Jun 07, 2023","Aug 02, 2023"

GSE239293,Metabolic Programs of T Cell Tissue Residency Empower Tumor Immunity [Human scRNA-seq],37648857,"Tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) offer fast, robust, and long-term protection at sites of re-infection1. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with characteristics of TRM maintain enhanced effector functions, predict responses to immunotherapy, and accompany better prognoses2,3. Thus, an improved understanding of the metabolic strategies that enable tissue residency could inform new approaches to empower T cell responses in tissues and solid tumors. To systematically define the basis for the metabolic reprogramming supporting TRM differentiation, survival, and function, we leveraged in vivo functional genomics, untargeted metabolomics, and transcriptomics of virus-specific memory CD8 T cell populations. We found that memory CD8 T cells deployed a range of adaptations to tissue residency, including a marked reliance on non-steroidal products of the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway, such as Coenzyme Q (CoQ), driven by increased activity of the transcription factor Srebp2. This metabolic adaptation was most pronounced in the small intestine (SI), where TRM interface with dietary cholesterol and maintain a heightened state of activation4, and was shared by functional TIL in diverse tumor types in mice and humans. Enforcing CoQ synthesis through Fdft1 deletion or Pdss2 overexpression promoted mitochondrial respiration, memory formation upon viral infection, and enhanced antitumor immunity. In sum, through a systematic exploration of TRM metabolism, we reveal how these programs can be leveraged to empower CD8 T cell memory formation in the context of acute infections and enhance antitumor immunity.","Single-cell RNA-seq of immune cell from 5 human donors, profiled in the same human study contained in GSE125527.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Reina-Campos M;Goldrath AW;Chang JT;Boland BS,UCSD,USA,GSM7662895;GSM7662896;GSM7662897;GSM7662898;GSM7662899;GSM7662900;GSM7662901;GSM7662902;GSM7662903;GSM7662904;GSM7662905;GSM7662906;GSM7662907,"Jul 28, 2023","Jul 26, 2023","Sep 08, 2023"
GSE217010,Identification of human exTregs as CD16+CD56+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells.,,"In chronic inflammatory diseases with an autoimmune component like atherosclerosis, some  regulatory T cells (Tregs) lose their regulatory function and become exTregs. The present study  was designed to identify surface markers specific of human exTregs, using an integrated  approach from sorted mouse exTregs bulk RNA-Seq to human scRNA-Seq with CITE-Seq, to  sort human exTregs and characterize them by transcriptome and function. We crossed inducible  Treg lineage tracker mice (FoxP3-eGFP-Cre-ERT2 ROSA26CAG-fl-stop-fl-tdTomato) to  atherosclerosis-prone Apoe -/- mice, sorted Tregs and exTregs from lymph nodes and spleens of  replicate mice and determined their transcriptomes by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A  support vector machine (SVM) approach identified the leading signature genes for exTregs as  CST7, NKG7, GZMA, PRF1, TBX21 and CCL4. Projecting these genes onto feature maps of  human PBMC single cell (sc)RNA-Seq with CITE-Seq from 61 subjects with and without  atherosclerosis showed that CST7, NKG7, GZMA, PRF1, TBX21 and CCL4 mapped to CD4 T  cells that expressed CD56 and CD16. This finding was validated in a second, independent  scRNA- and CITE-Seq dataset. Even in healthy volunteers, a subpopulation of CD4 T cells  expressed both CD56 and CD16. Bulk RNA-Seq identified these cells as cytotoxic CD4 T cells,  which was functionally confirmed in a cell killing assay. DNA sequencing for TCRβ showed  clonal expansion of Treg CDR3 sequences in CD16 + CD56 + exTregs.

Dendritic cells (DCs), major antigen-presenting cells, have been proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IDD. The AXL+SIGLEC6+ DC (ASDC) has been only recently identified in humans and has a high capability of T cell activation. Nevertheless, its contribution to CNS autoimmunity remains still obscure. Here, we aimed to identify the ASDC in diverse sample types from IDD patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A detailed analysis of DC subpopulations using single-cell transcriptomics for the paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of IDD patients (total n = 9) revealed that three subtypes of DCs (ASDCs, ACY3+ DCs, and LAMP3+ DCs) were overrepresented in CSF compared with their paired blood. Among these DCs, ASDCs were also more abundant in CSF of IDD patients than in controls, manifesting poly-adhesional and stimulatory characteristics. In the brain biopsied tissues of IDD patients, obtained at the acute attack of disease, ASDC were also frequently found in close contact with T cells. Lastly, the frequency of ASDC was found to be temporally more abundant in acute attack of disease both in CSF samples of IDD patients and in tissues of EAE, an animal model for CNS autoimmunity.

GSE219098,Tracking B Cell Responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccine,37440409,"The COVID-19 pandemic left an unprecedented social and economic impact on the world. This rapidly evolving global instigated a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine. Despite the generation of a protective antibody response in most individuals after two doses of an anti-spike mRNA vaccine, some studies have shown that a poorer response is elicited in some individuals, particularly those that are immunocompromised or elderly. To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms driving B cell evolution in response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic, epitope sequencing (CITE-seq), and repertoire profiling of three COVID-19 vaccinees. Spike-specific (S-2P+) B cells showed early immune activation at v1D14 (14 days after vaccine dose 1) and accumulation of somatic hyper mutation (SHM) up to v2M6 (months 6). At v2D6, the S-2P+ cells expanded into memory B cell (MBC) cluster 5 with a dynamic kinetics over time. At v2M6, majority of S-2P+ cells were into resting memory (RM) subset within cluster 5. Analysis of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire showed selection of genes commonly detected in neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Tracking of S-2P+ B cell response showed clonal association between earlier activated CD38+ memory, as well as tissue-like memory, with RM B cells at v2M6. These clones showed evolving signal with progressive accumulation of SHM over time. The presence of early plasmablast (PB) within these clones corroborates our previous report that associates PB response with sustained immunity. This integrated analysis allowed us to characterize the transcriptional activity underpinning the development of B cells involved in inducing an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine.","B cells of COVID-uninfected individuals who received Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine were isolated from thawed cryopreserved PBMC. Spike-specific and non-specific B cells, and total plasmablast were sorted. Cells from all individuals were pooled evenly before cell sorting. Multiple cell pools were prepared, such that cells from the same donors but different time points were in different pools. After cell sorting, cell pools were Fc blocked, CITE-seq and hashtag stained with custom TotalSeq-C cocktail antibodies.

Here we alleviate both bottlenecks by deploying fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells, intact nuclei or fixed cells and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold, while reducing background noise by up to half, depending on sample quality.

Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) have an increased frequency of IL-11+ monocytes, IL-11+ and IL-11R+ CD4+ lymphocytes and IL-11R+ neutrophils in comparison to matched healthy controls (HCs).  IL-11+ and GM-CSF+ monocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, and neutrophils accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The effect of IL-11 in-vitro stimulation, examined using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in classical monocytes, including upregulated NFKB1, NLRP3 and IL1B.  All CD4+ cell subsets had increased expression of S100A8/9 alarmin genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.  In IL-11R+-sorted cells from the CSF, classical and intermediate monocytes significantly upregulated the expression of multiple NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes, including complement, IL18, and migratory genes (VEGFA/B) in comparison to blood-derived cells. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway with aIL-11 mAb in mice with RR experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) decreased clinical scores, CNS inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination.  aIL-11 mAb treatment decreased the numbers of NFkBp65+, NLRP3+ and IL-1b+ monocytes in the CNS of mice with EAE.  The results suggest that IL-11/IL-11R signaling in monocytes represents a therapeutic target in RRMS.","IL-11R+ FACS sorted cells from peripheral blood of 3 MS patients, stimulated vs. unstimulated with IL-11.

GSE235050,scRNA-seq characterization of immune cell types among individuals with or without Long COVID,,"Long COVID (LC), a type of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), occurs after at least 10% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, yet its etiology remains poorly understood. Here, we used multiple “omics” assays (CyTOF, RNAseq/scRNAseq, Olink) and serology to deeply characterize both global and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity from blood of individuals with clear LC and non-LC clinical trajectories, 8 months following infection and prior to receipt of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells, which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues, and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and in contrast to non-LC individuals, exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. RNAseq and Olink analyses similarly revealed immune dysregulatory mechanisms, along with non-immune associated perturbations, in individuals with LC. Collectively, our data suggest that proper crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity has broken down in LC, and that this, perhaps in the context of persistent virus, leads to the immune dysregulation, inflammation, and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition.","SARS-CoV-2 serological analysis and four types of “omics” assays were performed on the same blood specimens from our cohort of LC and non-LC individuals (Fig. 1). Plasma/sera were analyzed for RBD-specific antibody levels, and for the levels of 394 analytes using the Olink platform. PBMCs from the same specimens were subjected to bulk RNAseq, as well as in-depth CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotyping using a 39-parameter CyTOF panel designed to simultaneously interrogate the differentiation states, activation states, effector functions, and homing properties of T cells (Table S2). Cells were phenotyped by CyTOF at baseline and following a 6-hour stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides to identify and characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells at the single-cell level through intracellular cytokine staining. The RNAseq/scRNAseq and Olink datasets, as well as the CyTOF datasets corresponding to total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, were visualized and analyzed using a variety of integrative high-dimensional analysis approaches (Fig. 1).

GSE183970,Gene-regulatory network study of rheumatoid arthritis in single-cell chromatin landscapes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells,35796437,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease with an elusive etiology. Assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with single-cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) contribute to the progress in epigenetic studies. However, the impact of epigenetic technology on autoimmune diseases has not been objectively analyzed. Therefore, scATAC-seq was performed to generate a high-resolution map of accessible loci in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients at the single-cell level. The purpose of our project was to discover the transcription factors (TFs) that were involved in the pathogenesis of RA at single-cell resolution. In our research, we obtained 22 accessible chromatin patterns. Then, 10 key TFs were involved in the RA pathogenesis by regulating the activity of MAP kinase. Consequently, two genes (PTPRC, SPAG9) regulated by 10 key TFs were found that may be associated with RA disease pathogenesis and these TFs were obviously enriched in RA patients (p<0.05, FC>1.2). With further qPCR validation on PTPRC and SPAG9 in monocytes, we found differential expression of these two genes, which were regulated by eight TFs (ZNF384, HNF1B, DMRTA2, MEF2A, NFE2L1, CREB3L4 (var. 2), FOSL2::JUNB (var. 2), MEF2B). What is more, the eight TFs showed highly accessible binding sites in RA patients. These findings demonstrate the value of using scATAC-seq to reveal transcriptional regulatory variation in RA-derived PBMCs, providing insights on therapy from an epigenetic perspective.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic auto-inflammatory disease with significant unknown etiology. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin in single cells sequencing (scATAC-seq) is related to great progress in epigenetic study, including cancer biology.

Hence, scATAC-seq was performed to profile a high-resolution map of accessible loci in RA at a single-cell level. We identified five major clusters using cell type-specific marker genes and further obtained 22 patterns of transcription factor (TF) among them. Consequently, our findings revealed five genes associated with RA pathogenesis in the T cell activity pathway and 43 remarkable enriched TF motifs in RA patients.

Here, we performed comprehensive single-cell profiling of precancerous lesions, localized and metastatic GACs, identifying alterations in TME cell states and phenotypes during tumorigenesis and progression. IgA+ plasma cells appear to be the most active regulators in the premalignant microenvironment, whereas immunosuppressive myeloid and stromal subsets dominated the late-stage GACs. We discover six TME ecotypes, four of which are unique to the premalignant/progression in the continuum, with two ecotypes, identified in primary GACs, showing strong associations with histopathologic, genomic characteristics and prognosis. Extensive stromal remodeling is evident with GAC progression. High SDC2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) correlates with aggressive phenotypes and poor survival and SDC2 overexpression in CAFs contributes to tumor growth.

Our study contains 47 individual human PBMC scATAC-seq experiments from a reference male and female donor. To streamline data analysis, we devised PUMATAC (https://github.com/aertslab/PUMATAC), a flexible and universal data analysis pipeline and best practices repository for scATAC-seq. Systematic technology-specific differences in sequencing library complexity and biases in tagmentation specificity were found to impact the accuracy of cell type annotation, genotype demultiplexing, peak calling, differential region accessibility, and motif enrichment.

Here, we report a method that for recovering paired, full-length variable region sequences of the BCRs from 3`-barcoded single-cell whole transcriptome libraries. We first verified this method could produce accurate, full-length BCR sequences. We then applied this method to profile antigen-specific B cell responses elicited against the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (ST3) by glycoconjugate vaccines in infant rhesus macaques. Using our method, we defined features of the BCR associated with specificity for the ST3 antigen and showed that these sequence characteristics are present in multiple vaccinated monkeys, indicating a convergent response to vaccination. These results demonstrate the utility of our method to resolve key features of the B cell repertoire and for profiling antigen-specific responses elicited by vaccination.",B cells of interest were isolated from PBMC using either fluorscence associated cell sorting or immunomagnetic selection and analyzed with the Seq-Well platform for single-cell RNA sequencing.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Morgan DM;Zhang Y;Kim J;Murillo M;Singh S;Loschko J;Surendran N;Patil SU;Kanevsky I;Chorro L;Love JC,MIT,USA,GSM7385293;GSM7385294;GSM7385295;GSM7385296;GSM7385297;GSM7385298;GSM7385299;GSM7385300;GSM7385301;GSM7385302;GSM7385303;GSM7385304;GSM7385305;GSM7385306;GSM7385307;GSM7385308;GSM7385309;GSM7385310;GSM7385311;GSM7385312;GSM7385313;GSM7385314;GSM7385315;GSM7385316;GSM7385317;GSM7385318;GSM7385319;GSM7385320;GSM7385321;GSM7385322;GSM7385323;GSM7385324;GSM7385325;GSM7385326;GSM7385327;GSM7385328;GSM7385329;GSM7385330;GSM7385331;GSM7385332;GSM7385333;GSM7385334;GSM7385335;GSM7385336;GSM7385337;GSM7385338;GSM7385339;GSM7385340;GSM7385341;GSM7385342;GSM7385343;GSM7385344;GSM7385345;GSM7385346;GSM7385347;GSM7385348;GSM7385349;GSM7385350;GSM7385351;GSM7385352;GSM7385353;GSM7385354;GSM7385355;GSM7385356;GSM7385357;GSM7385358;GSM7385359;GSM7385360;GSM7385361;GSM7385362;GSM7385363;GSM7385364;GSM7385365;GSM7385366;GSM7385367;GSM7385368;GSM7385369;GSM7385370;GSM7385371;GSM7385372;GSM7385373;GSM7385374,"May 19, 2023","May 19, 2023","May 22, 2023"

GSE213902,The utility of circulating CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,37009132,"Lack of reliable predictive biomarkers is a major limitation of combination therapy with chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy (chemo-immunotherapy). The increase of peripheral blood (PB) CD8+ T cells expressing CX3CR1, a marker of differentiation, correlates with response to anti-PD-1 therapy; however, the predictive and prognostic value of T-cell CX3CR1 expression during chemo-immunotherapy remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the utility of PB CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. At least 10% increase of the CX3CR1+ subset in circulating CD8+ T cells from baseline (CX3CR1 score) was associated with response to chemo-immunotherapy at 6 weeks (p = 0.0382) and 9 weeks (p = 0.0045). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of at least 10% increase of the CX3CR1 score was 83.3%, 88.2%, 83.3% and 88.2%, respectively with 86.2% overall accuracy of predicting response at 9 weeks. Furthermore, at least 10% increase of the CX3CR1 score correlated with improved overall (p = 0.0105) and progression-free survival (p = 0.0265). Combined T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of tumor tissue and single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of longitudinal PB samples from a patient who received a long-term benefit from chemo-immunotherapy demonstrated that circulating clonally expanded CD8+ T cells were terminal effector T cells expressing high levels of CX3CR1, and contained frequent tumor-infiltrating T-cell colonotypes early-on post treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential utility of T-cell CX3CR1 expression as a dynamic blood-based biomarker during the course of chemo-immunotherapy and a marker to identify frequent tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte repertoires.","Single live CD45+CD19–CD3+CD56– cells were enriched from cryopreserved PBMC samples obtained pre-treatment and on-treatment at 3, 6, 9 weeks by flow cytometry sorting using a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences).

GSE227709,"STING agonism leads to durable clinical response in an anti-PD-L1 refractory patient: Tumor antigen-specific, single cell level biomarker analyses.",,"Background: PD-1 pathway blockade has revolutionized cancer care, but many patients do not durably benefit from these therapies. Novel treatments to engage anti-tumor immunity in this setting are needed. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, an innate sensor of cytoplasmic DNA, is a promising target with several agonists in development; however, recent clinical trials of these agents have not demonstrated efficacy for most patients. Here, we present detailed biomarker analyses of a patient with anti-PD-L1 refractory Merkel cell carcinoma that had a durable (~1 year), abscopal response to ADU-S100 (intralesional STING agonist) combined with anti-PD-1 blockade.Methods: Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood acquired pre- and post-treatment were analyzed with single cell RNA sequencing, 27-color flow cytometry, T cell receptor sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC; post treatment tumor specimen only). Critically, cancer-specific CD8 T cells were identified using MHC-I tetramers containing peptides from the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), the etiologic agent of this cancer. Cell lines and tumor specimens from 76 patients were used to evaluate STING expression and signaling in MCC.Results: High levels of antigen cancer-specific T cells were observed in the tumor prior to ADU-S100 treatment (12% of T cells recognized an MCPyV epitope). These cancer-specific CD8 T cells exhibited characteristics of exhaustion including high TOX and low TCF1. Following STING agonist treatment, MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells expanded 3-fold with minimal phenotypic changes. An increase in antigen presentation on MCC tumor cells was also observed (1.8% of tumor cells MHC-I positive before treatment, 8.2% after treatment). This was not a result of ADU-S100 acting directly on tumor cells as mIHC analysis of 88 tumor samples confirmed little or no STING expression in tumor cells, but high STING expression on infiltrating immune and stromal cells. Further in vitro studies showed MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines are STING deficient, and ADU-S100 did not induce interferon.Conclusions: Our study suggests that STING agonists act on intratumoral immune cells to release interferons, which upregulate tumor cell antigen presentation and reinvigorate the anti-tumor response from pre-existing cancer-specific T cells. Thus, patients with anti-PD-(L)1-refractory disease showing downregulation of antigen-presentation may benefit from intralesional STING agonists.","We used 10x Genomic's Chromium Single Cell 5' Reagent Kits (v1.1 Chemistry Dual Index) with Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein and Immune Receptor to identify antigen specific T cell V(D)J sequences.

GSE227708,Cancer-specific CD8 T cell frequency at baseline in blood correlates with response to PD-1 blockade in Merkel cell carcinoma.,,"Understanding immunotherapy resistance is challenging due to difficulty identifying cancer-specific T cells. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is typically driven by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), facilitating identification of cancer-specific T cells across patients. We characterized cancer-specific T cells in 35 MCC patients, including participants in a neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 trial. Higher MCPyV-specific CD8 T-cell frequency in pre-treatment blood (but not tumors) correlated with response (p=0.005). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells in blood had increased stem/memory signatures and decreased exhaustion signatures relative to their intratumoral counterparts. While frequency of peripheral cancer-specific T cells was associated with response to initial PD-(L)1 blockade, longitudinal study of acquired resistance revealed immune evasion by tumor-cell MHC-I downregulation despite cancer-specific T cell expansion to 0.5% in blood. Blood thus appears to be an important reservoir of cancer-specific CD8 T cells and adoptive cell therapies may be particularly effective in patients without such cells.","We used 10x Genomic's Chromium Single Cell 5' Reagent Kits (v1.1 Chemistry Dual Index) with Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein and Immune Receptor to identify antigen specific T cell V(D)J sequences.

We retrospectively analyzed 12 kidney transplant recipients receiving pALG, and additional recipients receiving rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG), basiliximab, or no induction therapy as a comparison group. pALG showed high binding affinity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after administration, immediately depleting blood lymphocytes; an effect that was weaker than rATG but stronger than basiliximab. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that pALG mainly influenced T cells and innate immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils). By analyzing immune cell subsets, we found that pALG moderately depleted CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, regulatory T cells and NKT cells and mildly inhibited dendritic cells. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6) were only moderately increased compared with rATG, which might be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of untoward immune activation. During 3 months of follow-up, we found that all recipients and transplanted kidneys survived and showed good organ function recovery; there were no cases of rejection and a low rate of complications. In conclusion, pALG acts mainly by moderately depleting T cells and is thus a good candidate for induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients. The immunological features of pALG should be exploited for the development of individually-optimized induction therapies based on the needs of the transplant and the immune status of the patient, which is appropriate for non-high-risk recipients.",We performed single-cell sequencing on PBMCs obtained from one recipient preoperatively(ZZH20220826-0) and on POD7 (ZZH20220901-7).,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Zhang L;Zou H,Wuhan Institute of Biological Products,China,GSM7073188;GSM7073189,"Mar 01, 2023","Feb 28, 2023","Apr 25, 2023"
GSE223236,Cytotoxic T cells targeting spike glycoprotein are associated with hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2,36961450,"mRNA vaccination of individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides superior protection against breakthrough infections with variants of concern compared to vaccination in the absence of prior infection. However, the immune mechanisms by which this ‘hybrid immunity’ is generated and maintained are unknown. While genetic variation in spike glycoprotein effectively subverts neutralizing antibodies, spike-specific T cells are generally maintained against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, we comprehensively profiled T cell responses against the S1 and S2 domains of spike glycoprotein in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive or convalescent individuals who received two-dose mRNA vaccine series and were matched by age, sex, and vaccine type. Using flow cytometry, we observed that the overall functional breadth of CD4 T cells as well as polyfunctional Th1 responses were similar between the two groups. However, polyfunctional cytotoxic CD4 T cell responses against both S1 and S2 domains trended higher among convalescent subjects. Multi-modal single-cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse functional programs in spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in both groups. However, convalescent individuals displayed enhanced cytotoxic and antiviral CD8 T cell responses to both S1 and S2 in the absence of cytokine production. Taken together, our data suggest that cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells targeting spike glycoprotein may partially account for hybrid immunity and protection against breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2.","We performed multi-modal (surface protein, gene expression, and TCR) single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMC collected from SARS-CoV-2-naive (n = 4) and convalescent (n = 4) individuals following two-dose mRNA vaccination.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Phan JM;Yu KK;Aguilar MS;Golez I;Gale M Jr,University of Washington,USA,GSM6943744;GSM6943745;GSM6943746;GSM6943747;GSM6943748;GSM6943749,"Mar 01, 2023","Jan 19, 2023","May 31, 2023"

Thus, there is a need for interventions to augment and sustain such immunity. To address this, we characterized S protein-specific CD4+ T cells in healthy individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines utilizing high-dimensional single cell RNA-seq and mass cytometry. S protein-specific CD4+ T cells highly expressed IL-1 receptor (R) 1 and its decoy receptor IL-1R2. IL-1b promoted IFN-g expression by S protein-stimulated CD4+ T cells, which was furthered by adding anti-IL-1R2-blocking antibodies, supporting the functional implications of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2. Following the 2nd dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, IL-1R1 expression increased while IL-1R2 expression decreased in S protein-specific CD4+ T cells. Our findings provide novel insight into augmenting COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell immunity by modulating IL-1β and its receptor system, which could foster a more effective and prolonged immune response.","Multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq of human PBMC samples from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinated healthy subjects.

This deep patient profiling generates new mechanistic insight into this rare clinical entity and provides potential insight into other post-infectious syndromes.","Single-cell RNA-Seq library construction, alignment, and quality control: A total of 15,000 single cells (containing an equal proportion of leukocytes and lymphocytes) were loaded for partitioning using 10X Genomics NextGEM Gel Bead emulsions. All samples were processed as per manufacturer’s protocol (with both PCR amplification steps run 12X). Quality control and pre-loading cDNA quantification was performed using TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape assay. Sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq S2 and SP 100 cycle dual lane flow cells over multiple rounds to ensure each sample received approximately 32,000 reads per cell. Sequencing reads were aligned using CellRanger 3.1.0 pipeline to the standard pre-built GRCh38 reference genome. Samples that passed alignment QC were aggregated into single datasets using CellRanger aggr with between-sample normalization to ensure each sample received an equal number of mapped reads per cell. Aggregated healthy (n = 3) and recovered COVID-19 (n = 3) samples recovered 30,514 cells that were sequenced to 17,157 post-normalization reads per cell. Single-cell RNA-Seq computational analyses and workflows:Filtered feature-barcode HDF5 matrices from aggregated datasets were imported into the R package Seurat v.3.9 for normalization, scaling, integration, multi-modal reference mapping, louvain clustering, dimensionality reduction, differential expression analysis, and visualization. Briefly, cells with abnormal transcriptional complexity (fewer than 500 UMIs, greater than 25,000 UMIs, or greater than 15% of mitochondrial reads) were considered artifacts and were removed from subsequent analysis. Cell identity was classified by mapping single cell profiles to the recently published PBMC single-cell joint RNA/CITE-Seq multi-omic AZIMUTH reference. Since no published reference automates granulocyte annotations, neutrophil clusters were manually annotated by querying known markers (i.e. CSF3R, S100A8, S100A9, MMP8, MMP9, ELANE, MPO). A cell state-specific ‘perturbation score’ was calculated to reflect the magnitude of response elicited by factoring in number and cumulative FC of consensus DEGs. Perturbation scores were visualized using Nebulosa-generated density plots. Cells with high mitochondrial read were subsetted to enable further characterization of these cells, as there were high mitochondrial reads specifically in the first MIS-A sample.

GSE185991,Dormant leukemia stem cells reinforced by chemotherapy drive early treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia patients [scRNA_PT],,"Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by a minor fraction of primitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that sustain disease propagation and may be at the origin of late relapse. Yet, LSC contribution to early therapy resistance and AML regeneration remains controversial. We prospectively identified LSCs in NPM1-mutated AML patients and xenografts by means of a microRNA-126 reporter and single cell RNA sequencing, precisely discriminating LSCs from regenerating hematopoiesis, and assessed their longitudinal response to chemotherapy. We here show that chemotherapy resulted in distinct outcomes within AML subpopulations: while the bulk leukemia proliferated and differentiated with expression of oxidative-phosphorylation signatures, persisting miR-126high LSCs enforced protective stemness and dormancy features, along with a generalized inflammatory and senescence-associated response. miR-126high LSCs were enriched at diagnosis in patients with chemotherapy-refractory AML. We derived a novel miR-126high LSC transcriptional signature, which robustly stratified patients for overall survival in large AML cohorts, shining the spotlight on LSCs as determinants of early therapy resistance.",We undertook an extensive transcriptional characterization of diagnosis and matched early after treatment acute myeloid leukemia  blasts through bulk RNA sequencing of xenograft LSC enriched (GFPlow/miR-126high) and LSC depleted (GFPhigh/miR-126low) blast subpopulations coupled with unbiased single cell RNA sequencing of xenograft and patient samples.

To this end, we tracked αβT‐cell clones during stem cell mobilization treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in healthy donors and during immune reconstitution after transfer to transplant recipients. More than 250 αβT‐cell clones were tracked from donor to recipient. These clones consisted almost exclusively of CD8+ effector memory T cells (CD8TEM), which exhibited a different transcriptional signature with enhanced effector and cytotoxic functions compared to other CD8TEM. Importantly, these distinct and persisting clones could already be delineated in the donor. We confirmed these phenotypes on the protein level and their potential for selection from the graft. Thus, we identified a transcriptional signature associated with persistence and expansion of donor T-cell clones after alloHSCT that may be exploited for personalized graft manipulation strategies in future studies.",We designed our study to analyze peripheral blood lymphocytes of paired donor and recipient samples. We included five alloHSCT patients between December 2018 and May 2019 who received PB grafts from related donors at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Disease severity increases with age starting at 30 and reaches astounding mortality rates that are ~330 fold higher in persons above 85 years of age compared to those 18-39 years old. To understand age-specific immune pathobiology of COVID-19 we have analyzed soluble mediators, cellular phenotypes, and transcriptome from over 80 COVID-19 patients of varying ages and disease severity, carefully controlling for age as a variable. We found that reticulocyte numbers and peripheral blood transcriptional signatures robustly correlated with disease severity. By contrast, decreased numbers and proportion of naïve T cells, reported previously as a COVID-19 severity risk factor, were found to be general features of aging and not of COVID-19 severity, as they readily occurred in older participants experiencing only mild or no disease at all. Single-cell transcriptional signatures across age and severity groups showed that severe but not moderate/mild COVID-19 causes cell stress response in different T cell populations, and some of that stress was unique to old severe participants, suggesting that in severe disease of older adults, these defenders of the organism may be disabled from performing immune protection. These findings shed new light on interactions between age and disease severity in COVID-19.","Single cell RNA Seq analysis of Covid patients among the following categories: Severe Old, Severe Adult, Mild Old and Mild AdultPlease note that raw data for Patient 7 - Patient 15 samples were lost and thus are not provided.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Bhat R;Coplen CP;Jergovic M;Watanabe M;Zugich JN,University of Arizona,USA,GSM6537978;GSM6537979;GSM6537980;GSM6537981;GSM6537982;GSM6537983;GSM6537984;GSM6537985;GSM6537986;GSM6537987;GSM6537988;GSM6537989;GSM6537990;GSM6537991;GSM6537992,"Jan 11, 2023","Sep 02, 2022","Jan 12, 2023"

Methods enabling concurrent measurement of cellular protein secretion, phenotypes and transcriptomes are still unavailable. Here, we describe Time-Resolved Assessment of Protein Secretion from single cells by sequencing (TRAPS-seq). Released proteins are trapped onto cell surface and probed by oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies before simultaneously sequenced with transcriptomes in single cells. TRAPS-seq unravels the phenotypic and transcriptional determinants of the secretion of pleiotropic Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) in activated T cells. We further demonstrate the use of TRAPS-seq to track dynamic secretion of multiple cytokines over time, uncovering unique molecular signatures that govern the preservation or transition of single-cell cytokine secretions. Our results revealed that early central memory T cells with CD45RA expression (TCMRA) are important in both the production and maintenance of polyfunctional cytokines.

In this study we performed single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and genotyping in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 individuals. Clustering chromatin accessibility profiles of 96,002 total nuclei identified 17 immune cell types and sub-types. We mapped chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in each immune cell type and sub-type which identified ~6,000 total caQTL peaks, including those obscured from assays of bulk tissue such as with divergent effects on different cell types. For ~3,000 caQTLs we further annotated putative target genes of variant activity using single cell co-accessibility, and caQTL variants were significantly correlated with the accessibility level of linked gene promoters. We fine-mapped loci associated with 16 complex immune traits and identified immune cell caQTLs, including those with cell type-specific effects. At the 6q15 locus associated with type 1 diabetes, in line with previous reports, variant rs72928038 was a naïve CD4+ T cell caQTL linked to BACH2 and we validated the allelic effects of this variant on regulatory activity in Jurkat T cells.

GSE206265,Influenza vaccination reveals sex dimorphic imprints of prior mild COVID-19 [single-cell CITEseq],36599369,"Acute viral infections can have durable functional impacts on the immune system long after recovery, but how they affect homeostatic immune states and responses to future perturbations remain poorly understood. Here we use systems immunology approaches, including longitudinal multimodal single cell analysis (surface proteins, transcriptome, and V(D)J sequences), to comparatively assess baseline immune statuses and responses to influenza vaccination in 33 healthy individuals after recovery from mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19 (mean: 151 days after diagnosis) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls who never had COVID-19. At baseline and independent of time since COVID-19, recoverees had elevated T-cell activation signatures and lower expression of innate immune genes in monocytes. COVID-19-recovered males had coordinately higher innate, influenza-specific plasmablast, and antibody responses after vaccination compared to healthy male and COVID-19-recovered females, partly because male recoverees had monocytes with higher IL-15 responses early after vaccination coupled with elevated pre-vaccination frequencies of ""virtual memory"" like CD8+ T-cells poised to produce more IFNg upon IL-15 stimulation. In addition, the expression of the repressed innate immune genes in monocytes increased by day 1 through day 28 post-vaccination in recoverees, thus moving towards the pre-vaccination baseline of healthy controls. In contrast, these genes decreased on day 1 and returned to the baseline by day 28 in controls. Our study reveals sex-dimorphic impacts of prior mild COVID-19 and suggests that viral infections in humans can establish new immunological set-points impacting future immune responses in an antigen-agnostic manner.","Blood samples were collected on 33 subjects with prior symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (diagnosed by nasal PCR test) or asymptomatic infection (by antibody test), and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with no history of COVID-19, at each of the following timepoints relative to seasonal influenza vaccination (day 0): days -7, 0, 1, 7, 14, 28, 70, 100. Subjects between ages 18 – 64 years were administered the Flucelvax Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (2020-2021; Seqirus Inc, Summit, NJ), whereas those aged 65 years old and above were administered the high-dose Fluzone Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (2020-2021; Sanofi Pasteur Inc, Swiftwater, PA).   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from days 0, 1, and 28 among a selected group of 24 COVID19 patients and 16 healthy controls were profiled using multi-modal single cell CITE-seq, including surface protein staining (Biolegend TotalSeq-C lyophilized panel) and mRNA, on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Samples from different donors were pooled and different timepoints from the same donor were pooled separately so that each pool contains only one timepoint from one donor.

GSE214237,Transcriptomic profile of single-cell sorted CD14+ monocytes from 6 PBMC samples of individuals with active tuberculosis,36713384,"Previous studies suggest that monocytes are an important contributor to tuberculosis (TB)-specific immune signatures in blood. Here we carried out  single-cell profiling of classical CD14+CD16- and intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes  in paired blood samples of active TB (ATB) patients at diagnosis and end-treatment. At diagnosis, ATB patients displayed upregulation of interferon signaling genes that significantly overlapped with previously reported blood TB signatures in both CD14+ subsets. In ATB diagnosis, we identified additional transcriptomic and functional changes in intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes, such as the upregulation of inflammatory and MHC-II genes, and increased capacity to activate T cells, reflecting overall increased activation in this population. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that distinct subsets of intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes were responsible for each gene signature, indicating significant functional heterogeneity within this population. Finally, we observed that transcriptomic changes in CD14+ monocytes were transient, as they were no longer observed in the same ATB patients mid-treatment, suggesting they are associated with disease resolution.","Single-cell RNA sequencing of sorted CD14+ monocytes from 6 PBMC samples of individuals with active tuberculosis (4 samples at diagnosis, 2 paired samples at end of treatment, 6 months after diagnosis).

GSE192836,Lineage tracing identifies cutaneous lymphoid progenitor common for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome,,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that originate in the skin, with mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) representing the most common variants. The cellular origin of cutaneous lymphomas has remained controversial due to their immense phenotypic heterogeneity that obfuscates lineage reconstruction based on classical surface biomarkers. To overcome this heterogeneity and reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of malignant cells in MF and SS, T-cell receptor sequencing was performed in parallel with targeted transcriptomics at the single-cell resolution. Unsupervised lineage reconstruction discovered that peripheral Sézary cells emerged from CD4+ T cells similar to those in patch MF, but this developmental pathway was mutually exclusive with MF plaque and tumor progression.  Furthermore, Sézary cells phenotypically comprised at least three subsets based on differential proliferation potential and expression of exhausted markers. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that asymmetric differentiation of cutaneous lymphoid progenitors can lead to cutaneous progression into plaque/tumor MF, or alternatively give rise to the leukemic cells of SS.",high-throughput TCR sequencing in parallel with targeted single-cell transcriptomics coupled with AbSeq***raw data will be made available at dbGaP due to patient privacy concerns***,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens),Akilov OE,4126489982,USA,GSM5766434;GSM5766435;GSM5766436;GSM5766437;GSM5766438;GSM5766439;GSM5766440;GSM5766441;GSM5766442;GSM5766443;GSM5766444;GSM5766445;GSM5766446;GSM5766447;GSM5766448;GSM5766449;GSM5766450;GSM5766451,"Dec 31, 2022","Dec 31, 2021","Jan 02, 2023"

To be able to characterize these different forms of cellular heterogeneity in diverse types of samples, we developed scONE-seq, which enables simultaneous transcriptome and genome profiling in a one-tube reaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of scONE-seq by benchmarking it against existing methods using cell lines and lymphocytes from a healthy donor. Furthermore, we applied scONE-seq to a frozen years-old IDH1-mutant glioblastoma (GBM) sample and profiled over 1200 nuclei from a single sample, subsequently identifying a phenotypically normal-like

At present, few researches have compared immune cells in childhood with other age groups, and there is a lack of understanding of immune cells in childhood from the whole lifespan. To display the molecular characteristics of peripheral blood immune cells in childhood at the single-cell level, we performed a comparative study by constructing a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) atlas of multiple age groups, including children, young adults, middle-aged adults, aged adults and supercentenarians. The atlas revealed that monocytes in childhood were markedly different from those in other periods. B cells in childhood had a greater ability to respond to viruses and to activate mast cells. Remarkably, we identified a new subtype of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells expressing both naïve and cytotoxicity genes specifically in childhood. The marker genes of this subtypes were used as marker proteins for flow cytometry analysis, and the results confirmed the findings of the scRNA-seq. Moreover, there was more frequent crosstalk between PBMCs in childhood than in other periods, which may be one of the characteristics of the immune system in childhood. Finally, the differences in the expression of susceptibility genes in the PBMCs of different age groups may indicate differences in the disease spectrum of different age groups.

However, most studies focus on peripheral blood, which may not fully reflect immune responses in lymphoid tissues at the site of infection. To evaluate both local and systemic adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, we collected peripheral blood, tonsils, and adenoids from 110 children undergoing tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to investigate the adaptive immune response locally, we measured the neutralizing antibodies against to multiple SARS-CoV-2 virus variants and performed high dimensional flow cytometry and CITEseq including TCR and BCR analysis for deeper characterization of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In our CITE-seq analyses, we sorted SARS-CoV-2 S1 (spike 1) binding (Spike1+) and non-binding (Spike1-) CD19+ B cells from tonsils, adenoids, and PBMCs from two subjects with a history of COVID-19 and one uninfected control.

GSE186459,Bacterial membrane phosphatidylglycerols activate a population of human CD1a-restricted t cells,36550321,"Expressed on epidermal Langerhans cells, CD1a presents a range of self-lipid antigens found within the skin. However, the extent to which CD1a presents microbial ligands from skin bacteria is unclear. Here, we identified CD1a-dependent T cell responses to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a ubiquitous bacterial membrane phospholipid, as well as to lysyl phosphatidylglycerol (lysylPG), a modified PG, present in the many gram positive bacteria, and highly abundant in Staphylococcus aureus. Specifically, PG and lysylPG together constitute the vast majority of the structural membrane lipids in Staphylococcus aureus. The crystal structure of the CD1a-lysylPG complex showed that the acyl chains were buried within the A′- and F′-pockets of CD1a, while the lysine-modified phosphoglycerol headgroup protruded from the F′-portal and was available for T cell receptor contact. Using lysylPG-loaded CD1a tetramers, we identified T cells in peripheral blood and in skin that respond to this lipid in a dose dependent manner.

PRMT5 is implicated in lymphomagenesis, but its role in CLL or RT progression is unknown. We demonstrate herein that tumors uniformly overexpress PRMT5 in patients with progression to RT. Furthermore, mice with B-specific overexpression of hPRMT5 developed a B-lymphoid expansion with increased risk of death, and Eµ-PRMT5/TCL1 double transgenic mice uniformly developed a highly aggressive disease that histologically resembles RT; where large-scale transcriptional profiling identified unique oncogenic pathways that mediate PRMT5-driven disease progression.

We hypothesized that the ability of cDC1 to relay CD4+ T-cell help for the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response explains their clinical benefit. In vitro, contact with activated CD4+ T-cells enabled human cDC1, but no other DC types, to induce a CTL response to cell-associated tumor antigens. Single cell transcriptomics revealed that CD4+ T-cell help uniquely optimized cDC1 and no other DC types in many functions that support antigen cross-presentation and T-cell priming.

GSE214360,DUSP6 mediates resistance to JAK2 inhibition and drives leukemic progression (microarray),,"Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, resulting in limited treatment options and dismal clinical outcomes. Here, we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases, identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation, while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore, ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance, while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically, DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1, which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality, whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 potently and specifically suppressed disease development across Jak2 V617F and MPL W515L MPN mouse models, as well as sAML PDXs, without inducing toxicity in healthy controls. These findings underscore DUSP6 in driving disease transformation and therapeutic resistance, and highlight the DUSP6-RSK1 axis as a novel, druggable pathway in myeloid malignancies.","Microarray analysis of sorted CD34+ HSPCs from MPN, sAML, and healthy donors",Expression profiling by array,[HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version],Kong T;Oh ST,Washington University School of Medicine,USA,GSM6604669;GSM6604670;GSM6604671;GSM6604672;GSM6604673;GSM6604674;GSM6604675;GSM6604676;GSM6604677;GSM6604678;GSM6604679;GSM6604680;GSM6604681;GSM6604682;GSM6604683;GSM6604684;GSM6604685;GSM6604686;GSM6604687;GSM6604688;GSM6604689;GSM6604690;GSM6604691;GSM6604692;GSM6604693,"Oct 25, 2022","Sep 28, 2022","Oct 27, 2022"

Recent evidence indicates that mechanisms that induce dysfunction of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1) in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are drivers of the lack of responsiveness to checkpoint immunotherapy. However, the impact of PDAC on systemic type 2 cDC2 development and function has not been well studied. Herein, we report the analysis of 3 cohorts, totaling 106 samples, of human blood and bone marrow (BM) from patients with PDAC for changes in cDCs. We found that circulating cDC2s and their progenitors were significantly decreased in the blood of patients with PDAC, and repressed numbers of cDC2s were associated with poor prognosis. Serum cytokine analyses identified IL6 as significantly elevated in patients with PDAC and negatively correlated with cDC numbers. In vitro, IL6 impaired the differentiation of cDC1s and cDC2s from BM progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human cDC progenitors in the BM and blood of patients with PDAC showed an upregulation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway and a corresponding impairment of antigen processing and presentation.

We previously demonstrated that injection of pegylated interferon-lambda1 (PEG-IFN-λ) accelerated viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. To determine if the viral decline was mediated by enhanced immunity, we assessed in vivo responses to PEG-IFN-λ by single cell RNA sequencing and measured SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and antibody responses between placebo and PEG-IFN-λ-treated patients. PEG-IFN-λ treatment induced interferon stimulated genes in peripheral immune cells expressing IFNLR1, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. PEG-IFN-λ did not affect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels or the magnitude of virus-specific T cells. However, we identified delayed T cell responses in older adults, suggesting that PEG-IFN-λ can overcome delays in adaptive immunity to accelerate viral clearance in high-risk patients.

GSE207935,A human STAT3 gain-of-function variant confers T cell dysregulation without predominant Treg dysfunction in mice [single cell RNA-seq],36136607,"Primary immune regulatory disorders (PIRD) are a group of disorders characterized by immune dysregulation, presenting with a wide range of clinical disease including autoimmunity, autoinflammation, or lymphoproliferation. Autosomal dominant germline gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 result in a PIRD with a broad spectrum of clinical features and prior studies have documented a decreased frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and an increased frequency of Th17 cells is some patients. However, the precise mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in STAT3 GOF syndrome remain largely unknown. We developed a knock-in mouse model harboring a de novo pathogenic human STAT3 variant (p.G421R) and found these mice developed T cell dysregulation, lymphoproliferation and CD4+ Th1 cell skewing. Surprisingly, Treg cell numbers, phenotype, and function remained largely intact, however mice had a selective deficiency in the generation of iTreg cells. In parallel, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF syndrome. We demonstrate only minor changes in the Treg cell transcriptional signature and an expanded, effector CD8+ T cell population. Together, these finding suggest Treg cells are not the primary driver of disease and highlight the importance of preclinical models in the study of disease mechanisms in rare PIRD.",3 healthy age- and sex-matched donors (C1-C3) and 3 patients with STAT3 GOF syndrome (P1-P3),Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Schmitt EG;Cooper MA;Kolicheski A,Washington University in St Louis,USA,GSM6323487;GSM6323488;GSM6323489;GSM6323490;GSM6323491;GSM6323492;GSM6323493;GSM6323494;GSM6323495;GSM6323496;GSM6323497;GSM6323498,"Oct 14, 2022","Jul 11, 2022","Mar 22, 2023"
GSE215125,HIV specific CD8+ Trm-like cells in tonsils express exhaustive signatures in the absence of natural HIV control [Seqwell],36330531,"Lymphoid tissues are an important HIV reservoir site that persists in the face of antiretroviral therapy and natural immunity. Targeting these reservoirs by harnessing the antiviral activity of local tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T-cells is of great interest, but limited data exist on TRM-like cells within lymph nodes of people living with HIV (PLWH). Here, we studied tonsil CD8+ T-cells obtained from PLWH and uninfected controls from South Africa. We show that these cells are preferentially located outside the germinal centers (GCs), the main reservoir site for HIV, and display a low cytolytic and transcriptionally TRMlike profile distinct from blood CD8+ T-cells. In PLWH, CD8+ TRM-like cells are highly expanded and adopt a more cytolytic, activated, and exhausted phenotype not reversed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). This phenotype was enhanced in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells from tonsils compared to matched blood suggesting a higher antigen burden in tonsils. Single-cell transcriptional and clonotype resolution showed that these HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in the tonsils express heterogeneous signatures of T-cell activation, clonal expansion, and exhaustion ex-vivo. Interestingly, this signature was absent in a natural HIV controller, who expressed lower PD-1 and CXCR5 levels and reduced transcriptional evidence of T-cell activation, exhaustion, and cytolytic activity. These data provide important insights into lymphoid tissue-derived HIVspecific CD8+ TRM-like phenotypes in settings of HIV remission and highlight their potential for immunotherapy and targeting of the HIV reservoirs.",This dataset is comprised of seven scRNA-Seq samples.

The prevailing  inadequate efficacy of seasonal vaccines, both conventional and elderly-tailored, is a crucial bottleneck. Consequentially, understanding immunological and molecular mechanisms resulting in differential influenza  vaccine responsiveness is a prerequisite for the development of new or improved vaccination strategies. To assess differences within the specific risk group of the elderly, randomly selected individuals (≥ 65 years) were immunized with the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad®. Samples were subjected to single cell transcriptome analysis. The analyses revealed profound features segregating vaccine responders from nonresponders as classified according to their vaccine-induced sero-conversion. Non-responders are characterized by a poorly functional, suppressive phenotype, showing a weaker humoral and cellular immune activation and more suppressive regulatory T and B cells. Triple responders display an efficient immune functionality characterized by the activation of humoral and cellular immunity and the up-regulation of genes related to signaling pathways, including those for anti-viral responses, protein processing and B cell activation.

NKT-like cells can be expanded ex vivo into cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, however this therapeutic cell product has had mixed results against hematological malignancies in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine if NKT-like cells mobilized during acute cycling exercise could be used to generate more potent anti-tumor CIK cells from healthy donors. An acute exercise bout increased NKT-like cell numbers in blood 2-fold. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that exercise mobilized NKT-like cells have an upregulation of genes and transcriptomic programs associated with enhanced anti-tumor activity, including cytotoxicity, cytokine responsiveness, and migration. Exercise, however, did not augment the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells or alter their surface phenotypes after 21-days of culture. CIK cells expanded at rest, during exercise (at 60% and 80% VO2max) or after (1h post) were equally capable of killing leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma target cells with and without cytokine (IL-2) and antibody (OKT3) priming in vitro. We conclude that acute exercise in healthy donors mobilizes NKT-like cells with an upregulation of transcriptomic programs involved in anti-tumor activity, but does not augment the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells.","Blood samples were collected from 3 healthy volunteers (age 27-41 yrs) at rest, during graded exercise at 80% VO2max, and at 1hr post exercise (+1H).

Although CITE-seq and other similar technologies have quickly gained enormous popularity, novel methods for analyzing this new type of single cell multi-omics data are still in urgent need. A limited number of available tools utilize data-driven approach, which may undermine the biological importance of surface protein data. In this study, we developed SECANT, a biology-guided SEmi-supervised method for Clustering, classification, and ANnoTation of single-cell multi-omics. SECANT can be used to analyze CITE-seq data, or jointly analyze CITE-seq and scRNA-seq data. The novelties of SECANT include 1) using confident cell type labels identified from surface protein data as guidance for cell clustering, 2) providing general annotation of confident cell types for each cell cluster, 3) fully utilizing cells with uncertain or missing cell type labels to increase performance, and 4) accurate prediction of confident cell types identified from surface protein data for scRNA-seq data. Besides, as a model-based approach, SECANT can quantify the uncertainty of the results, and our framework can be easily extended to handle other types of multi-omics data. We successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of SECANT via simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real datasets.

GSE184031,Single Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of MCL Patient Samples,,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, highly heterogeneous type of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) driven by multiple genetic mutations disrupting cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. Despite advances in therapy, novel treatment approaches are needed especially for highly proliferative MCL which has a particularly progressive clinical course even in the era of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase therapy. The sumoylation pathway is known to be upregulated in many cancers including lymphoid malignancies. However, little is currently known about the role of the sumoylation pathway and its oncogenic potential in MCL. We found extensive upregulation of the sumoylation pathway in MCL, particularly at the level of the E1 enzymes SAE1 and SAE2, with elevated expression levels of sumoylation enzyme components showing a worse prognosis and a strong positive correlation with cell cycle associated genes. Targeting the sumoylation pathway with TAK-981, a first in class sumoylation inhibitor currently being investigated in a clinical study of B-cell NHL in combination with rituximab (NCT04074330), resulted in potent loss of sumoylation in MCL cells with significant activity in in-vitro and in vivo models of MCL, including ibrutinib resistance cases. We found mitotic dysregulation to be an important, although not all encompassing mechanism of cell death upon loss of sumoylation of TAK-981 in MCL cells. We uncovered a diverse sumoylation program upon mitosis entry that was significantly reduced with TAK-981. Centromeric localization of the well known sumoylation substrate topoisomeraseIIA (TopIIA) was significantly abrogated upon mitosis entry, likely contributing at least in part to the mitotic dysregulation seen in MCL cells. This mechanism is highly relevant as TopIIA is significantly upregulated in MCL with SAE1/2 overexpression. Our study, in addition to the recently described immunomodulatory activity of TAK-981, not only validates SAE1/2 as a therapeutic target in MCL but also opens the door to further mechanistic work to uncover how to best use desumoylation therapy to treat MCL and other lymphoid malignancies.",4 Samples were collected from 4 patients.

Systematic interrogation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is vital to the prediction of immunotherapy response and the development of innovative immunotherapeutics. To comprehensively characterize the immune microenvironment in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing in unselected viable cells from 16 matched samples. We identified nineteen cell subsets from a total of 45,851 cells, in which exhausted CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in BTC were shown to augment and communicate within the TME. Transcriptional profiles coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequences revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells retained clonal expansion and high proliferation in the TME, and some of them highly expressed the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) sensor XBP1, indicating its key role in remodeling TME. Functional assays demonstrated that XBP1 and common immune checkpoints (PD1, TIGIT) were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells cocultured within the TME of BTC cell lines (GBC-SD, HCCC-9810). When treating the coculture groups with the specific inhibitor of IRE1α-XBP1 (4μ8C), the downregulation of TIGIT was observed in the treatment group.

We use multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic and epitope sequencing to profile greater than 200,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from advanced BTC patients (n=9) and matched healthy donors (n=8). Following anti-PD-1 treatment, CD14+ monocytes expressing high levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemotactic molecules (CD14CTX) increase in the circulation of patients with BTC tumors that are CPI-resistant. CD14CTX can directly suppress CD4+ T cells and induce SOCS3 expression in CD4+ T cells rendering them functionally unresponsive. The CD14CTX gene signature associates with worse survival in patients with BTC as well as in other anti-PD-1 refractory cancers.

Still, many patients do not experience durable responses and the reasons for clinical success versus failure remain largely undefined. Investigation of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment can be highly informative but access to tumor tissue is not always available, highlighting the need to identify biomarkers in the blood that correlate with clinical success. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor sequencing to define CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood of two patients with melanoma before and after immunotherapy with either anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) alone or the combination of anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab). Both treatment regimens increased transcripts associated with cytolytic effector function and decreased transcripts associated with naive T cells. These responses were further evaluated at the protein level and extended to a total of 53 patients with various cancer types. Unexpectedly, the induction of CD8+ T cell responses associated with cytolytic function was variable and did not predict therapeutic success in this larger patient cohort. Rather, a decrease in the frequency of T cells with a naive-like phenotype was consistently observed after immunotherapy and correlated with prolonged patient survival. In contrast, a more detailed clonotypic analysis of emerging and expanding CD8+ T cells in the blood revealed that a majority of individual T cell clones responding to immunotherapy acquired a transcriptional profile consistent with cytolytic effector function. These results suggest that responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy are evident and traceable in patients’ blood, with outcomes predicted by the simultaneous loss of naive-like CD8+ T cells and the expansion of mostly rare and diverse cytotoxic CD8+ T cell clones.","T Cells were isolated from human PBMCs, purified by FACS based on CD8+ and CD4+ staining and processed for single cell RNAseq using the 10X Genomics platform.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Khojandi N;Teague RM,Saint Louis University School of Medicine,USA,GSM6474817;GSM6474818;GSM6474819;GSM6474820;GSM6474821;GSM6474822;GSM6474823;GSM6474824;GSM6474825;GSM6474826;GSM6474827;GSM6474828,"Aug 23, 2022","Aug 17, 2022","Aug 26, 2022"

Here, we show that Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human lung cancers harbor a completely different open chromatin profile compared to effector T cells and peripheral Treg cells. The integrative sequencing analyses revealed that BATF, IRF4, NF-κb, and NR4A were important transcription factors for Treg cell differentiation in the TME. Particularly, BATF was identified as a key regulator, which leveraged Treg cell differentiation through epigenetically controlling activation-associated gene expression, resulting in the robustness of Treg cells in the TME. BATF deficiency in Treg cells remarkably inhibited tumor growth and high BATF expression was associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma. Our results propose the specific chromatin remodeling and differentiation program of Treg cells in the TME, which can be applied in the development of Treg cell-targeted therapies.","bulk RNA-seq about T cell subsets (Treg cells, Tconv cells and CD8+ T cells)",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens),Itahashi K;Irie T;Nishikawa H,+81-4-7133-1111,Japan,GSM6448309;GSM6448310;GSM6448311;GSM6448312;GSM6448313;GSM6448314;GSM6448315;GSM6448316;GSM6448317;GSM6448318;GSM6448319;GSM6448320;GSM6448321;GSM6448322;GSM6448323;GSM6448324;GSM6448325;GSM6448326;GSM6448327;GSM6448328;GSM6448329;GSM6448330;GSM6448331;GSM6448332;GSM6448333;GSM6448334;GSM6448335;GSM6448336;GSM6448337;GSM6448338;GSM6448339;GSM6448340;GSM6448341;GSM6448342;GSM6448343;GSM6448344;GSM6448345;GSM6448346;GSM6448347;GSM6448348;GSM6448349;GSM6448350;GSM6448351;GSM6448352;GSM6448353;GSM6448354;GSM6448355;GSM6448356;GSM6448357;GSM6448358;GSM6448359,"Aug 22, 2022","Aug 11, 2022","Nov 21, 2022"

GSE136035,IL-4-induced quiescence of resting naïve B cells is disrupted in systemic lupus erythematosus,36165181,"Activated naïve (aNAV) B cells have been shown to be the precursor of the CD11c+T-bet+ IgD−CD27− double negative (DN)2 or atypical memory (aMEM) B cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  To determine factors that maintain resting naïve (rNAV) B cells, the transcriptomics program in naïve (IGHD+IGHM+) B cells in human healthy controls (HC) and SLE was analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing analysis. In HC, naive B cells expressed IL-4 pathway genes whereas in SLE, naive B cells expressed type I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs).  In HC, aNAV B cells exhibited upregulation of gene signature of germinal center (GC) and classical memory (cMEM) B cells.  In contrast, in SLE, aNAV B cells expressed signature genes of aMEM.  In vitro exposure of SLE B cells to IL-4 promoted B cell development into CD27+CD38+ plasmablasts/plasma and IgD−CD27+ cMEM B cells. The same treatment blocked the development of CD11c+Tbet+ aNAV and DN2 B cells and preserved DN B cells as CD11c−Tbet− DN1 B cells.  Lower expression of IL-4R and increased intracellular IFN-β in naïve B cells was correlated with the accumulation of CD21−IgD− B cells and the development of anti-Smith and anti-DNA autoantibodies in SLE patients (n=47).  Our results show that IL-4R and type I IFN signaling in naïve B cells induce the development of distinct lineages of cMEM versus aMEM B cells, respectively.  Further, a diminished IL-4R signaling shifted activated B-cell development from the DN1 to the DN2 trajectory in SLE patients.   Therapies that enhance IL-4R signaling may be beneficial for ISGhi SLE.

GSE210065,Circulating monocytes associated with anti-PD-1 resistance in human biliary cancer induce T cell paralysis [CITE-seq],36130508,"Suppressive myeloid cells can contribute to immunotherapy resistance, but their role in response to checkpoint inhibition (CPI) in anti-PD-1 refractory cancers, such as biliary tract cancer (BTC), is largely unknown. We use multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic and epitope sequencing to profile greater than 200,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from advanced BTC patients (n=9) and matched healthy donors (n=8). Following anti-PD-1 treatment, CD14+ monocytes expressing high levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemotactic molecules (CD14CTX) increase in the circulation of patients with BTC tumors that are CPI-resistant. CD14CTX can directly suppress CD4+ T cells and induce SOCS3 expression in CD4+ T cells rendering them functionally unresponsive. The CD14CTX gene signature associates with worse survival in patients with BTC as well as in other anti-PD-1 refractory cancers. These results demonstrate that monocytes arising after anti-PD-1 treatment can induce T cell paralysis as a distinct mode of tumor-mediated immunosuppression leading to CPI resistance. ","Blood samples from patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) and healthy donors were processed using ficoll; after centrifugation, the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layer was isolated and cryopreserved in cell media with human serum and DMSO. Previously frozen PBMCs were thawed using media containing RPMI, heat-inactivated sterile filtered human serum, penicillin-streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine.

We combined histological analyses using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses of the lungs from autopsy samples and single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate the pathogenesis of vasculitis and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. We found that SARS-CoV-2 accumulated in the pulmonary vessels, causing exudative vasculitis accompanied by the emergence of thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1)-expressing non-canonical monocytes and the formation of Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9)-containing microthrombi in the lung of COVID-19 patients with fatal disease. The amount of plasma Myl9 in COVID-19 was correlated with the clinical severity and measuring plasma Myl9 together with other markers allowed us to predict the severity of the disease more accurately.

GSE200996,Tissue-resident Memory and Circulating T cells are Early Responders to Pre-surgical Cancer Immunotherapy,35803260,"Pre-surgical (neoadjuvant) immune checkpoint blockade has shown promising activity in multiple cancer types, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we characterized early kinetic changes in tumor-infiltrating and circulating immune cells in oral cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 in a phase 2 clinical trial. Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells that clonally expanded during immunotherapy expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs compared to non-responding cells. These programs were already active in pre-treatment T cells that later responded, reflecting a capacity for rapid response. Treatment also induced a systemic immune response, including expansion of pre-existing and emergent T cell clonotypes undetectable prior to therapy. The frequency of activated blood CD8 T cells, including pretreatment PD-1-positive KLRG1-negative T cells, was strongly associated with intra-tumoral pathological response, and these activated cells were enriched for tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes. These results demonstrate how neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade induces local and systemic tumor immunity.","Samples from 30 patients from 2 different cohorts (anti-PD-1  monotherapy, anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy)",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens),Wucherpfennig KW,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,USA,GSM6048142;GSM6048143;GSM6048144;GSM6048145;GSM6048146;GSM6048147;GSM6048148;GSM6048149;GSM6048150;GSM6048151;GSM6048152;GSM6048153;GSM6048154;GSM6048155;GSM6048156;GSM6048157;GSM6048158;GSM6048159;GSM6048160;GSM6048161;GSM6048162;GSM6048163;GSM6048164;GSM6048165;GSM6048166;GSM6048167;GSM6048168;GSM6048169;GSM6048170;GSM6048171;GSM6048172;GSM6048173;GSM6048174;GSM6048175;GSM6048176;GSM6048177;GSM6048178;GSM6048179;GSM6048180;GSM6048181;GSM6048182;GSM6048183;GSM6048184;GSM6048185;GSM6048186;GSM6048187;GSM6048188;GSM6048189;GSM6048190;GSM6048191;GSM6048192;GSM6048193;GSM6048194;GSM6048195;GSM6048196;GSM6048197;GSM6048198;GSM6048199;GSM6048200;GSM6048201;GSM6048202;GSM6048203;GSM6048204;GSM6048205;GSM6048206;GSM6048207;GSM6048208;GSM6048209;GSM6048210;GSM6048211;GSM6048212;GSM6048213;GSM6048214;GSM6048215;GSM6048216;GSM6048217;GSM6048218;GSM6048219;GSM6048220;GSM6048221;GSM6048222;GSM6048223;GSM6048224;GSM6048225;GSM6048226;GSM6048227;GSM6048228;GSM6048229;GSM6048230;GSM6048231;GSM6048232;GSM6048233;GSM6048234;GSM6048235;GSM6048236;GSM6048237;GSM6048238;GSM6048239;GSM6048240;GSM6048241;GSM6048242;GSM6048243;GSM6048244;GSM6048245;GSM6048246;GSM6048247;GSM6048248;GSM6048249;GSM6048250;GSM6048251;GSM6048252;GSM6048253;GSM6048254;GSM6048255;GSM6048256;GSM6048257;GSM6048258;GSM6048259;GSM6048260;GSM6048261;GSM6048262;GSM6048263;GSM6048264;GSM6048265;GSM6048266;GSM6048267;GSM6048268;GSM6048269;GSM6048270;GSM6048271;GSM6048272;GSM6048273;GSM6048274;GSM6048275;GSM6048276;GSM6048277;GSM6048278;GSM6048279;GSM6048280;GSM6048281;GSM6048282;GSM6048283;GSM6048284;GSM6048285;GSM6048286;GSM6048287;GSM6048288;GSM6048289;GSM6048290;GSM6048291;GSM6048292;GSM6048293;GSM6048294;GSM6048295;GSM6048296;GSM6048297;GSM6048298;GSM6048299;GSM6048300;GSM6048301;GSM6048302;GSM6048303;GSM6048304;GSM6048305;GSM6048306;GSM6048307;GSM6048308;GSM6048309;GSM6048310;GSM6048311;GSM6048312;GSM6048313;GSM6048314;GSM6048315;GSM6048316;GSM6048317;GSM6048318;GSM6048319;GSM6048320;GSM6048321;GSM6048322;GSM6048323;GSM6048324;GSM6048325;GSM6048326;GSM6048327;GSM6048328;GSM6048329;GSM6048330;GSM6048331;GSM6048332;GSM6048333;GSM6048334;GSM6048335;GSM6048336;GSM6048337;GSM6048338;GSM6048339;GSM6048340;GSM6048341;GSM6048342;GSM6048343;GSM6048344;GSM6048345,"Jul 07, 2022","Apr 18, 2022","Oct 07, 2022"
GSE193220,Single cell profiling of γδ hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma unravels tumor cell heterogeneity associated with disease progression,36417130,"Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare but very aggressive lymphoma mostly derived from γδ T cells. The molecular pathogenesis driving HSTCL is largely unknown while only limited treatment options are available with poor outcomes. In this study, we performed paired single cell RNA-seq and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on biopsies collected from a HSTCL patient pre- and post- chemotherapy treatments. We characterized unique gene expressing signatures of malignant γδ T cells with a set of marker genes were newly identified in HSTCL (AREG, PLEKHA5, VCAM1 etc.). Although the malignant cells were expanded from a single TCR clonotype according to their TCR sequences, they evolved into two transcriptional distinct tumor subtypes during the disease progression. The Tumor_1 subtype was dominant in pre-treatment samples with highly aggressive phenotypes. The Tumor_2 had relative mild cancer hallmark signatures but expressed genes associated with survival and drug resistance (IL32, TOX2, AIF1, AKAP12 etc.), and finally became the major tumor subtype post-treatment. We further dissected the tumor microenvironment of the HSTCL and found CD8 memory T cells were clonal expanded post-treatment. In addition, we discovered dynamically rewiring cell-cell interaction networks during the treatment. The tumor cells had reduced interactions with the microenvironment post-treatment. Our study reveals heterogenous and dynamic tumor and microenvironment underlying pathogenesis of HSTCL and may contribute to identify novel targets for diagnosis and cure of HSTCL in the future.",Bone marrow and PBMC biopsies were collected from a HSTCL patient pre- and post- chemotherapies.

GSE180045,Identification of Pathogenic Immune Cell Subsets in Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Myocarditis,35762356,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies used widely to activate the immune system against tumor cells. Despite their therapeutic benefits, ICIs are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAE) such as myocarditis, a rare but serious side effect with up to 50% mortality. To identify pathogenic immune subset(s) responsible for ICI myocarditis and other irAE, we performed single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 40 patients and controls with irAE including four patients with ICI myocarditis. We also profiled 15 patients/controls using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with feature barcoding for surface marker expression confirmation. In both CyTOF/scRNAseq analyses, we found expansions of cytotoxic CD8+ T effector cells re-expressing CD45RA (Temra CD8+ cells) in ICI myocarditis patients compared to controls. Using T cell receptor sequencing, we demonstrated a significant clonal expansion of CD8+ Temra cells in myocarditis patients. Transcriptomic profiling of these Temra CD8+ clones confirmed their highly activated and cytotoxic phenotype with expression of granzyme/perforin. Longitudinal data revealed the progression of these Temra CD8+ cells into an exhausted phenotype two months after diagnosis of myocarditis and after treatment with glucocorticoids. Differential expression of several proinflammatory chemokines (CCL4/CCL4L2/CCL5) was uncovered in the clonally expanded Temra CD8+ cells and ligand-receptor analysis implicated their regulation of other inflammatory cells such as monocytes and NK cells. These data suggest that the therapeutic modulation of these chemokines may serve as an attractive strategy for reducing life-threatening irAE in ICI-treated cancer patients.","PBMCs were collected and isolated from three main patient groups: Group A - patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors without any known immune adverse events (irAEs), Group B - patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors with non-myocarditis irAEs, Group C - patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors with myocarditis.

GSE178882,A pilot study of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors,,"Background: Preclinical work has demonstrated that ibrutinib inhibits the generation, migration and immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). A pilot study tested the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors.Methods: Sixteen patients with metastatic solid malignancies were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg) daily and nivolumab (240 mg) IV on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycles.  Ibrutinib dosing started 7 days before cycle 1 of nivolumab and was given until cycle 1, day 8 of nivolumab. The effect of ibrutinib alone and in combination with nivolumab on circulating MDSC and immune subsets and cytokine/chemokine levels were measured. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing was also performed.Results: The most common treatment-related AEs were fatigue (31%) and anorexia (31%). Five patients had a clinical response (4 partial, 1 complete). Four patients had stable disease at 3 months. Median progression-free survival was 3.5 months and median overall survival 10.8 months. MDSC levels increased following 7 days of single-agent ibrutinib compared to baseline (21.91% vs. 27.67%). There was increased T cell proliferation in response (33.9% vs. 40.06%, p<0.01) to the combination regimen. Plasma levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL13, IL- 8, and VEGF-α decreased with ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib treatment altered the transcriptional state of the myeloid cell compartment and led to increased cancer-associated TCR clonotypes.Conclusion: The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab was well tolerated and ibrutinib significantly impacted MDSC and T cell function in patients with solid metastatic tumors.","16 patients with metastatic solid tumors were treated with a combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab.

GSE206455,Differential chromatin accessibility in peripheral blood mononuclear cells underlies COVID-19 disease severity prior to seroconversion [scATAC-Seq],35810186,"SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers profound and variable immune responses in human hosts. Chromatin remodeling has been observed in individuals severely ill or convalescing with COVID-19, but chromatin remodeling early in disease prior to anti-spike protein IgG seroconversion has not been defined. We performed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from outpatients with mild or moderate symptom severity at different stages of clinical illness. Early in the disease course prior to IgG seroconversion, modifications in chromatin accessibility associated with mild or moderate symptoms were already robust and included severity-associated changes in accessibility of genes in interleukin signaling, regulation of cell differentiation and cell morphology. Furthermore, single-cell analyses revealed evolution of the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcription factor motif accessibility for individual PBMC cell types over time. The most extensive remodeling occurred in CD14+ monocytes, where sub-populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were observed prior to seroconversion. Mild symptom severity was marked by upregulation classical antiviral pathways, including those regulating IRF1 and IRF7, whereas in moderate disease, these classical antiviral signals diminished, suggesting dysregulated and less effective responses. Together, these observations offer novel insight into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of diagnostic tools for COVID-19.",Identify transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of sub-populations of CD14+ monocytes that distinguished IgG- subjects with mild from moderate symptoms.,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Woods CW,Duke University,USA,GSM6254833;GSM6254834;GSM6254835;GSM6254836;GSM6254837;GSM6254838;GSM6254839;GSM6254840;GSM6254841;GSM6254842;GSM6254843;GSM6254844;GSM6254845;GSM6254846;GSM6254847;GSM6254848;GSM6254849;GSM6254850;GSM6254851;GSM6254852;GSM6254853;GSM6254854;GSM6254855;GSM6254856;GSM6254857;GSM6254858;GSM6254859;GSM6254860;GSM6254861;GSM6254862;GSM6254863;GSM6254864;GSM6254865;GSM6254866;GSM6254867;GSM6254868;GSM6254869;GSM6254870;GSM6254871;GSM6254872;GSM6254873;GSM6254874,"Jun 23, 2022","Jun 20, 2022","Apr 05, 2023"

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been approved for treatment of patients with HCC. The effect of ICI on ILCs has not been explored. Methods: We studied ILCs in PBMCs of 51 patients with HCC at baseline and after treatment with ICI. Flow cytometry was used to study ILC composition. Single-cell RNA-sequencing using a targeted panel of 405 immune-related genes was used to characterize the transcriptomic profiles as well as cellular trajectory of ILCs before and after ICI therapy. Intracellular cytokine staining was used to validate ILC function. Data from large patient cohorts were used to predict association with survival. Results: Characterization of the ILC subgroups in PBMCs of HCC patients revealed a significant increase in ILC1 and a decrease in ILC3 frequencies. Single cell RNA-sequencing identified a subgroup of NK-like ILCs which expressed cytotoxicity markers as well as NKp80/KLRF1. This KLRF1high-NK-like population showed low abundance in patients with HCC and was enhanced after combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Trajectory analysis placed this population in between ILC1 and ILC3s. The transcriptomic signature of KLRF1high NK-like ILCs was associated with better progression-free survival in HCC cohorts. Conclusions: We present a previously unknown effect of HCC tumors and ICIs on the composition and plasticity of ILCs in PBMCs.  We identified a cytotoxic KLRF1high-NK-like subgroup which was associated with better survival, absent in untreated HCC patients, and enhanced upon ICI immunotherapy. Thus, ILCs from PBMC can be used to study changes in the innate immune system under immunotherapy.","PBMC samples from 3 healthy volunteers, 3 patients with HCC before immunotherapy and 3 patients with HCC after therapy with tremelimumab and durvalumab",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Heinrich B;Greten TF;Korangy F,240-760-6114,USA,GSM5842359;GSM5842360;GSM5842361;GSM5842362;GSM5842363;GSM5842364;GSM5842365;GSM5842366;GSM5842367,"Jun 23, 2022","Jan 28, 2022","Jul 20, 2022"

GSE178430,Multi-omics gene regulatory network analysis of resting and stimulated PBMCs [PBMC isolate scRNA-seq],,"Cells require coordinated control over gene expression changes when responding to environmental stimuli. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled studies of regulatory dynamics associated with cellular perturbation response in immune cells. However, associating these changes to underlying differences in epigenetic regulation through integration of multi-omic data has not been achieved at single-cell resolution. Here, we apply single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq to assay chromatin accessibility and gene expression in resting and stimulated human blood cells. Collectively, we generate ~91,000 high-coverage single-cell profiles, allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of immunological response across cell types, stimuli and time. Advancing tools to integrate multiomic data, we connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, identifying key regulatory hubs associated with immune signaling and stress response. Subsequently, we design FigR - a method to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate TF regulators across single cells.

Thymosin α 1 (Tα1) was considered being applied in COVID-19 therapy. However, there were limited clinical evidence to support. We aimed to study the immune and inflammation response to COVID-19 under Tα1 treatment and confirm its clinical benefit.  Methods   We did a cohort study including COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers with or without Tα1 treatment. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples. Single cell RNA-sequencing (ScRNA-seq) and T cell receptor-sequencing (TCR-seq) was done to test for  immune responses.  Findings   The proportion of CD3+KLRD1+ NKT, TBX21+CD8+ NKT was significant higher in Health controls with Tα1 treatment (HCT) than those without Tα1 (HC) (p=0.016; p=0.031). The proportion of CD3+KLRD1+ NKT, TBX21+CD8+ NKT was also observed increase in COVID-19 patients with Tα1 treatment (COVT) than those without Tα1 (COV) (p=0.024; p=0.010). The proportion of CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+ classical monocyte was significant lower in COVT in comparison with COV. Those cell sets were significantly associated with thymosin intervention (CD3+KLRD1+ NKT, p=0.028; TBX21+CD8+ NKT, p=0.003; CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+ classical monocyte, p=0.047).

Little is known about the transcriptional program of latent cells. Here we report a novel strategy to enrich clones of latent cells carrying intact, replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses from blood based on their expression of unique T cell receptors. Latent cell enrichment enabled single cell transcriptomic analysis of 1,050 CD4 + T cells belonging to expanded clones harboring intact HIV-1 proviruses from 6 different individuals. The analysis revealed that most of these cells are T effector memory cells that are enriched for expression of HLA-DR, HLA-DP, CD74, CCL5, Granzymes A and K, cystatin F, LYAR and DUSP2.

GSE182861,Single-cell RNA sequencing unveils the clonal and transcriptional landscape of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas,35421230,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, arising from clonal expansion of transformed skin-homing memory T cells. However, the lack of specific markers for malignant lymphocytes prevents distinguishing them from benign T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of MF, thus delaying diagnosis and development of specific treatment, which results in poor clinical outcomes. Here we employed recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish the transcriptome of expanded T-cell clones directly in advanced-stage MF skin tumors, allowing the transcriptional profiles of malignant and reactive T lymphocytes to be distinguished. Our analysis identified multiple non-overlapping expanded T-cell clonotypes within individual MF tumors, which included malignant and reactive clones. Heterogeneity among samples was observed not only in the number of expanded clonotypes but also in their TCR specificity and gene expression. While patient-specific tumorigenic pathways were up-regulated by the malignant clones, we also identified a common gene expression that included genes associated with cancer cell metabolism, de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, and invasion. Most non-malignant clones originated from CD8+ T cells and commonly presented an exhausted immune phenotype and activated Th1/Th2 pathways. While non-clonal infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from all tumors shared anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways, patient-specific mechanisms included the TNFR2 signaling cascade, ferroptosis, and cytotoxic pathways by gamma/delta T cells. Thus, scRNAseq reveals new insights in MF pathogenesis by providing an unprecedented report of the transcriptomes of malignant and reactive T cells in the TME of individual patients and offers novel prospective targets for personalized therapy.",4 MF samples and 4 normal samples were analyzed for gene expression and TCR expression. 4 SZ samples and 3 healthy PBMC samples were analyzed for gene expression and TCR expression. 2 blood/skin samples from same patient were analyzed. ,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Gaydosik AM;Stonesifer CJ;Gerskin LJ;Fuschiotti  P,University of Pittsburgh,USA,GSM5538777;GSM5538778;GSM5538779;GSM5538780;GSM5538781;GSM5538782;GSM5538783;GSM5538784;GSM5538785;GSM5538786;GSM5687767;GSM5687768;GSM5687769;GSM5687770;GSM5687771;GSM5687772;GSM5687773;GSM5687774;GSM5687775;GSM5687776;GSM5687777,"Jun 01, 2022","Aug 26, 2021","Aug 31, 2022"

GSE166945,T helper 2-biased transcriptional profile predicts HIV envelope-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that correlated with reduced risk of infection in RV144 trial,,"Despite the critical role antigen-specific T cells play in containing viral infections, their aggregate frequencies in peripheral blood have not correlated with clinical protection during HIV infection. However, a subset of HIV-specific T cells, which are capable of simultaneously producing multiple effector cytokines, termed polyfunctional T cells, have correlated with delayed disease progression. HIV-specific polyfunctional T cells have been enumerated and characterized using the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay, which allows for simultaneous multiplexed analysis of cytokine expression at the single-cell level. In addition, using an unbiased computational analysis of ICS data generated through the RV144 HIV vaccine case-control study, we identified vaccine-induced HIV envelope (Env)-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells as a novel correlate of reduced risk of HIV infection. However, very little is known about these cells and what differentiates them from other vaccine-elicited T cells.  In addition, the use of sample fixation in the ICS assay prevents those cells from being further interrogated for transcriptional differences.  Thus, we developed a novel live-cell multiplexed cytokine capture assay which allows for identification, sorting and transcriptional profiling of individual antigen-specific polyfunctional T cells by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).  We applied these methods to peripheral blood samples from participants who had received the RV144 vaccine regimen as part of the HVTN 097 clinical trial.  Using this approach, we discovered transcriptional signatures that specifically identify the single-cell Env-specific CD4 T-cell functional profiles which had correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection in RV144.  Interestingly, this signature is particularly characterized by upregulation of Th2 cytokines, supporting the hypothesis that the vaccine-induced Env-specific CD4 T cells likely contributed to the reduced risk of infection by providing T cell help to the Env-specific antibody responses.  By interrogating the gene signatures that correlated with polyfunctionality, we have identified potential mechanisms of how vaccine-elicited polyfunctional T cells may contribute to reduced risk of HIV infection.",• Developed novel ex vivo multiplexed cytokine capture assay to enumerate and sort live polyfunctional T cells for downstream analyses  • Polyfunctional T cells were specifically detected among the vaccine-stimulated T cells  • Sc-RNA sequencing analysis identified novel surface markers enriched among vaccine-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells  • Identified Th2

GSE203406,Proximal tubule cells in blood and urine have potential as biomarkers for kidney disease biopsies,,"Early diagnosis and treatment is pivotal to the management of kidney disease, whereas the pathological mechanisms and minimally invasive diagnostic method still need to be investigated. In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of kidney diseases in single cell level. Cellular gene expression profiles of cells of renal tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and urine from four nephritis patients were performed. Our analysis revealed 12 subsets of renal cells and leukocytes, including fibroblast cells, mesangial cells, epithelial cells, proximal tubule cells (PTCs), and 6 types of immune cells, CD8+ T cell, macrophages (MC), nature killer cells (NK), dendritic cells (DC), B cell and neutrophils. PTCs were detected in both PBMC and urine, while PTC was negative in healthy blood sample. Multiple populations of fibroblast cells, mesangial cells and PTCs demonstrated pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic responses. Gene expression analysis suggested that chemotactic and activating effect of inflammatory PTCs and fibroblasts on neutropils were critical for the development and progress of nephritis, which was supported by the widely overexpressed pro-inflammatory genes in these cells. Gene expression profiles of inflammatory PTCs in PBMC, urine and kidney are highly correlated, indicating the high possibility of urine and PBMC PTCs in serving as a surrogate for kidney biopsies.","In the present study, we aim to find out novel biomarkers from blood or urine by analysis cells from blood and urine using scRNA-seq, which may provide alternative minimally or noninvasive diagnostic method for kidney diseases.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Zhou D;Zeng Y;Liu F;Chen G,"Center, First People's  Hospital of Foshan",China,GSM6171482;GSM6171483;GSM6171484,"May 23, 2022","May 19, 2022","May 26, 2022"
GSE203217,IL-33-activated calcitonin gene-related peptide-producing memory Th2 cells co-operate with somatosensory neurons to induce conjunctival itch,,"Allergic conjunctivitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by severe itch in the conjunctiva; but how neuro-immune interactions shape the pathogenesis of severe itch remains unclear. We identified a subset of memory-type pathogenic Th2 cells that preferentially expressed Il1rl1-encoding ST2 and Calca-encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the inflammatory conjunctiva using a single-cell analysis. The IL-33-ST2 axis in memory Th2 cells controlled the axonal elongation of the peripheral sensory C-fiber and the induction of severe itch. Pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of CGRP signaling in vivo attenuated scratching behavior. The analysis of giant papillae from patients with severe allergic conjunctivitis revealed ectopic lymphoid structure formation with the accumulation of IL-33-producing epithelial cells and CGRP-producing pathogenic CD4+ T cells accompanied by peripheral nerve elongation. Thus, the IL-33-ST2-CGRP axis directs severe itch with neuro-reconstruction in the inflammatory conjunctiva and is a potential therapeutic target for severe itch in allergic conjunctivitis.","White blood cells of CD45+CD31- fractions that were freshly prepared from mice conjunctival tissue and sorted using a BD FACS Aria III (10,000 cells each, cell viability >98%) were encapsulated into droplets, and libraries were prepared using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3 according to manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics).

GSE203081,Single-Cell RNA Sequencing to Decipher the Immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 Vaccines in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases,35979368,"Objectives: To investigate the differences in efficacy and safety between the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and mRNA-based vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and evaluate the impact of anti-rheumatic medications on immunogenicity in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD). Methods: From September 16 to November 15, 2021, we consecutively enrolled participants aged≥20 years with AIRD who received COVID-19 vaccination. The level of serum IgG antibodies to the SARS-Cov-2 receptor-binding domain on the spike protein S1 subunit was quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. The immunogenicity and adverse reactions between ChAdOx1 nCov-19/AZD1222 and mRNA-1273 were compared.  Results: Of the 243 rheumatic disease patients who received COVID-19 vaccines, 113 and 130 were immunized with AZD1222 and mRNA-1273, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate was 78.8% (89/113) for AZD1222 and 83.1% (108/130) for mRNA-1273. The level of anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG was higher in patients who received mRNA-1273 than in those who received AZD1222. Prednisolone-equivalent dose >5 mg/day, methotrexate (MTX), non-anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a biologics, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor use were associated with inferior immunogenicity. All reported adverse reactions were minor. More localized pain at the injection site and less fever and chills were observed in patients receiving mRNA-1273 compared with those receiving AZD1222. Rheumatic disease activities after vaccination remained stable in most patients. Conclusions: mRNA-1273 and AZD1222 vaccines exhibited differential immunogenicity and adverse reaction profiles.

We then compared the profiles of cells from atrial blood with those of peripheral venous blood and found that a great difference in the gene expression profiles of T cells and B cells. We speculate that this difference is due to the pulmonary circulation and peripheral capillaries.

GSE148223,Marking the difference in acutely responding human CD8 T cells,35496820,"The CD8 T cell response features functions that are fundamental for long-lasting immune protection, including antigen-specific cytolysis and memory. Accordingly, a range of differentiation subsets have been described with diverse functionalities and corresponding profiles of expression of markers. In both mouse and human systems, a major distinction has been “memory” versus “effector” terms. On the one hand, these terms may relate to temporality within the immune response : “effector” indicates the acute phase, “memory” refers to the post-contraction, resting phase. On the other hand, the terms also assign prototypic differentiation phenotypes that may be found at the same time-point : memory or effector subsets, based on characteristic markers. In this study, we analyse the human CD8 T cell response to YF-17D vaccination as the best-known model of acute immune response in humans. We study 21 characteristic markers conventionally used in mice and in humans to analyse and describe differentiation, activation, cycling, and so-called effector functions such as cytokine production and degranulation. We find clearly distinct ‘acute traits’ at the peak of the response that are shared amongst all non-naïve antigen-specific subsets, including in memory phenotype cells. These acute traits were low BCL-2 and high Ki67, CD38, HLA- DR, as well as increased Granzyme B and Perforin, which have been previously attributed only to effector cells at the peak of the response. Altogether, we evidenced ‘acute traits’ independent of differentiation phenotypes, supporting the semantic and marker distinction between “effector” and “acute” terms in the human CD8 T cell response.","Single cell ATAC sequencing of CD8 T cells derived  from peripheral blood samples and sorted into different subsets: naïve, SCM or effector. Naive are polyclonal; SCM and effector either polyclonal or A2/LLW-specific. Three donors were sampled 14 days after YF-17D vaccination, i.e. at the peak of the acute phase of immune response.

GSE180697,A dynamic single cell-based framework for digital twins to prioritize disease genes and drug targets,35513850,"A major health care problems today is that drug treatment is ineffective for many patients. This may depend on the involvement of thousands of genes, which vary between patients with the same diagnosis at different time points. Identification and prioritization of upstream regulatory (UR) genes for precision medicine are therefore great challenges. In this study, we present a framework to model dynamic cellulome- and genome-wide changes in digital twins, to prioritize UR genes. We used seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model because the external trigger (pollen) is known, so that the disease process can be mimicked by time series analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated PBMC from SAR patients. Based on single cell profiling data from different stages of the disease, we constructed network models, hypothesizing that the directed molecular interactions between cell types could be traced to find an UR cell type and gene. This hypothesis was rejected because the cellular interactions formed multi-directional networks, rather than linear hierarchies. Instead, we were successfully able to rank and prioritize the URs based on their relative effects on the different cell types. We propose that this ranking strategy is a scalable approach for organizing and analyzing cellulome- and genome-wide data in digital twins.","Data from scRNA-seq analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as well as healthy controls.

Here, we cultivated blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that NAFLD BOECs were activated with chemokine hallmarks, in particular, enhanced CXCL12 was confirmed in arterial tissues of mouse NAFLD models. Immunoprofiling by single-cell analysis further uncovered T cell intensification and potentially T-helper type 1 inflammatory reactions in NAFLD. In evaluating CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in chemotaxis, CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) substantially modulated the migration of CD4+ Tcells, natural killer cells and monocytes towards NAFLD BOECs, which was not observed in healthy control coculture. We found that NAFLD and healthy BOECs might preferentially recruit distinct subsets of immune cells, as a result of unique chemokine ligand-receptor interactions. Finally, we enumerated two folds more circulating endothelial cells, a biomarker of vascular injury, in NAFLD patients than healthy subjects.

GSE200107,Single-Cell immunoprofiling after immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis reveals functional suppression of pathogenic Th2 cells and clonal conversion,35863510,"Background: Allergic rhinitis is a growing problem worldwide and the only treatment that modifies the cause of the disease is antigen-specific immunotherapy; however, its mechanism(s) of action are not fully understood.   Objective: Here, we comprehensively investigated the role and changes of antigen-specific T cells before and after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP).   Methods: We cultured PBMCs obtained both before and at one-year after initiating SLIT and used a combination of single-cell RNA sequence and repertoire sequencing. To investigate biomarkers, we used PBMCs from patients participating a phase II/III trial of SLIT tablets for JCP and PBMCs from good and poor responders in outpatients.   Results: Antigen-stimulated culturing after SLIT led to clonal expansion of Th2 and Treg cells, and most of these CD4+ T cells retained their CDR3 regions before and after treatment, indicating antigen-specific clonal responses and differentiation secondary to SLIT. However, SLIT reduced the number of clonal functional Th2 cells but increased the Trans-type Th2 cell population that expresses musculin (MSC), TGF-β, and IL-2. Trajectory analysis suggested that SLIT induced clonal differentiation of the Trans-type Th2 cells differentiated into Treg cells. By using real-time PCR, we found that MSC levels increased after 1 year of treatment in the active SLIT group and good responders.   Conclusion: The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire analysis helped reveal a part of the underlying mechanism— that SLIT promotes the expression of MSC on pathogenic Th2 cells and suppresses their function, and that MSC may be a potential biomarker of SLIT for allergic rhinitis.    Clinical implications  MSC expression was higher in the group of active patients who were responsive to SLIT, indicating that these molecules may be potential biomarkers of SLIT efficacy.",scRNA-seq and scVDJ-seq of 14 PBMC samples collected from 7 patients suffering from Japanese cedar pollinosis before and 1 year after SLIT treatment.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Iinuma T;Kiuchi M;Hirahara K;Kurita J;Kokubo K;Yagyu H;Yoneda R;Arai T;Sonobe Y;Fukuyo M;Kaneda A;Yonekura S;Nakayama T;Okamoto Y;Hanazawa T,Chiba univercity,Japan,GSM6008809;GSM6008810;GSM6008811;GSM6008812;GSM6008813;GSM6008814;GSM6008815;GSM6008816;GSM6008817;GSM6008818;GSM6008819;GSM6008820;GSM6008821;GSM6008822;GSM6008823;GSM6008824;GSM6008825;GSM6008826;GSM6008827;GSM6008828;GSM6008829;GSM6008830;GSM6008831;GSM6008832;GSM6008833;GSM6008834;GSM6008835;GSM6008836;GSM6008837;GSM6008838,"Apr 07, 2022","Apr 04, 2022","Aug 08, 2022"

Active mTORC1 facilitates increased metabolic activity, type I IFN and TNF production, and the expression of SLC7A11, a subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, xc—. We found that co-expression of SLC7A5, SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 is a major transcriptional signature shared by cytokine-producing pDC in vitro, and pDC at sites of autoimmune kidney damage in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

GSE189981,Enhanced cortical neural stem cell identity through short SMAD/WNT inhibition in human cerebral organoids facilitates emergence of outer radial glial cells.,35697781,"Cerebral organoids exhibit broad regional heterogeneity accompanied by limited cortical cellular diversity under a variety of derivation methods, suggesting inadequate patterning of early neural stem cell (NSC) starting populations. Here we show that a short combined Dual SMAD/WNT inhibition course during early organoid establishment is sufficient for yielding robust and lasting cortical identity with efficient suppression of non-cortical fates in organoid NSCs. In contrast, other widely used methods are inconsistent in their cortical specification capacity. Furthermore, combined inhibition selectively enriches for outer radial glia (oRG) cells in organoids that demarcate well-defined outer sub-ventricular (oSVZ)-like regions. Finally, combined inhibition enables superior NSC radial organization, further facilitates the generation of molecularly distinct deep and upper cortical layer neurons, and uncovers cortex-specific microcephaly defects. Thus, combined inhibition is critical for establishing a rich cortical cell repertoire, for enabling fundamental cytoarchitectural features of cortical development, and for meaningful disease modeling.",Single cell RNA-sequencing of brain organoids from 4 iPSC lines across 3 derivation protocols after 50 days and 80 days in culture.

GSE198616,Single-cell transcriptomics  highlights the proinflammatory contribution of C1q-high monocytes to Behçet’s disease,35727985,"Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic vasculitis characterized by systemic immune aberrations. Here, we performed single-cell sequencing to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated monocytes from BD patients and healthy donors. We observed prominent expansion and transcriptional changes in monocytes in PBMCs from BD patients. Deciphering the monocyte heterogeneity revealed the accumulation of C1q-high (C1qhi) monocytes in BD. Pseudotime inference indicated that BD monocytes markedly shifted their differentiation toward inflammation-accompanied and C1qhi monocyte-ended trajectory. Further experiments showed that C1qhi monocytes enhanced phagocytosis and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and multi-platform analyses revealed the significant clinical relevance of this subtype. Mechanistically, C1qhi monocytes were induced by activated IFN-γ signaling in BD patients, and were decreased by tofacitinib treatment. Our study illustrates BD immune landscape and the unrecognized contribution of C1qhi monocytes to BD hyperinflammation, showing their potential as therapeutic targets and clinical assessment indexes.","This dataset contains single-cell sequencing results of PBMCs (BD: n=4, HC: n=4) and isolated CD14+monocytes (BD: n=4, HC: n=4) .

GSE195725,Characterizing cellular heterogeneity in chromatin state with scCUT&Tag-pro,,"New technologies that profile chromatin modifications at single-cell resolution offer enormous promise for functional genomic characterization. However, the sparsity of these measurements and the challenge of integrating multiple binding maps represent significant challenges. Here we introduce scCUT&Tag-pro, a multimodal assay for profiling protein-DNA interactions coupled with the abundance of surface proteins in single cells. In addition, we introduce scChromHMM, which integrates data from multiple experiments to infer and annotate chromatin states based on combinatorial histone modification patterns. We apply these tools to perform an integrated analysis across nine different molecular modalities in circulating human immune cells. We demonstrate how these two approaches can characterize dynamic changes in the function of individual genomic elements across both discrete cell states and continuous developmental trajectories, nominate associated motifs and regulators that establish chromatin states, and identify extensive and cell type-specific regulatory priming. Finally, we demonstrate how our integrated reference can serve as a scaffold to map and improve the interpretation of additional scCUT&Tag datasets.","We focused on acquiring scCUT&Tag-pro data from healthy human PBMC, and aimed to study the genome-wide localization patterns for six histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3).",Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Zhang B;Srivastava A;Satija R,New York Genome Center,USA,GSM5849206;GSM5849207;GSM5849208;GSM5849209;GSM5849210;GSM5849211;GSM5849212;GSM5849213;GSM5849214;GSM5849215;GSM5849216;GSM5849217;GSM5849218;GSM5849219;GSM5849220;GSM5849221;GSM5849222;GSM5849223;GSM5849224;GSM5849225;GSM5849226;GSM5849227;GSM5849228;GSM5849229,"Feb 24, 2022","Jan 30, 2022","Feb 28, 2022"
GSE190202,Tumor infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells dictate divergent survival outcomes in pre- versus post-menopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,35132960,"CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), yet have no association with survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC. The basis for these contrasting findings remains elusive. We identify subsets of BC tumors infiltrated by CD8+ T cells with characteristic features of exhausted T cells (TEX). Tumors with abundant CD8+ TEX exhibit a distinct tumor microenvironment marked by amplified interferon-γ signaling related pathways and higher PD-L1 expression. Paradoxically, high levels of CD8+ TEX TILs associate with decreased overall survival ER+ BC patients, but not TNBC patients. Moreover, high tumor expression of a CD8+ TEX signature identifies dramatically reduced survival in pre-menopausal, but not post-menopausal, ER+ BC patients. Finally, we demonstrate the value of a tumor TEX signature score in identifying high-risk pre-menopausal ER+ BC patients amongst those with intermediate Oncotype Dx breast recurrence scores. Our data highlight the complex relationship between CD8+ TILs, interferon-γ signaling, and estrogen receptor status in BC patient survival. This work identifies pre-menopausal ER+ BC patients with high levels of tumor infiltrating CD8+ TEX as a high-risk subset that may benefit from immunotherapy strategies.","We employed single cell sequencing of patient CD8+ T cells from 10 different BC patients, including 9 primary tumors, 2 T+LNs, 3 NCBTs, and 7 matched PBMCs samples. CD8+ T cells stained for PD-1, CD39, CD103, CD69, CD137, and CCR7 were single cell index sorted for downstream whole transcriptome analysis.

In this study, we performed the single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the profiles of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the healthy controls (HC), asymptomatic individuals (AS) and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (SM) with various clinical features and disease severity. We first identified nine major cell types, including T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), platelets, neutrophils, plasma cells and stem cells from a total of 119,799 single cells captured and filtered for the final analysis, and then divided these cell types into separate cell clusters and sub-clusters, respectively. We revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in profound alternations in various cellular compartments and identified a number of distinct immune cell subsets that were associated with various clinical presentations, disease severity and viral persistence of COVID-19. (NCAM1+CD160+) NK cells increased significantly in AS and SM individuals compared with the HC. SM patients showed a significant increase in (LAG3+CD160+CD8+) NKT cells and a decrease in (CD4-CD8-) double negative T cells compared with the AS subjects. (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (SD) than the patients with moderate disease (MD). (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes and (CLEC10A-S100A9lo)pDC were positively and negatively correlated with the age-related disease severity of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Increases in (CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+) classical monocytes and (CLEC10A-S100A9lo)pDC were associated with long-term nucleic acid test positive (LTNP) patients compared with the short-term nucleic acid test positive (STNP) individuals. Increases in (LAG3+CD160+CD8+) NKTcells and (FOXP3+IL2RA+IL7R+CD4+) Treg cells were observed in a patient lacking B cells and plasma cells. Dramatic increases in neutrophils, (CD33-HLA-DMA-CD14+) classical monocytes, and (CD68-CSF1R-IL1BhiCD14+) classical monocytes were detected at a later stage of a fatal patient.

GSE175694,Single-cell ATAC-seq of circulating leukocytes reveals global epigenetic alterations as a prognostic factor in critical illness,35124428,"Background: While bulk and single cell transcriptomic patterns in circulating leukocytes from trauma patients have been reported, how these relate to changes in open chromatin patterns remain unstudied. Here, we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes.Methods: We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4hr, 24hr, 72hr post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness. Findings: Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression).Interpretation: The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses. Early detection of both the global epigenetic signature and the known immune transcriptomic patterns associates with the worse prognosis in trauma, burns and sepsis.","We longitudinally single-cell ATAC sequenced circulating mononuclear cells in 4 trauma patients (<4hrs, 24hrs and 72hrs post injury) along with paired healthy controls, total 16 samples.",Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Billiar TR;Singh H;Conroy J;Chen T;Namas RA;Vodovotz Y;Chen W,University of Pittsburgh,USA,GSM5344320;GSM5344321;GSM5344322;GSM5344323;GSM5344324;GSM5344325;GSM5344326;GSM5344327;GSM5344328;GSM5344329;GSM5344330;GSM5344331;GSM5344332;GSM5344333;GSM5344334;GSM5344335,"Feb 03, 2022","May 27, 2021","Feb 11, 2022"

GSE193736,A genome-scale screen for synthetic drivers of T-cell proliferation,35296855,"The engineering of patient T-cells for adoptive cell therapies has revolutionised the treatment of several cancer types. However, further improvements are needed to increase response and cure rates. CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens have been limited to negative regulators of T-cell functions and raise safety concerns due to permanent genome modification. Here we identify positive T-cell regulators via overexpression of ~12,000 barcoded human open reading frames (ORFs). The top-ranked genes increased primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation, activation, and secretion of key cytokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. In addition, we developed a single-cell genomics method (OverCITE-seq) for high-throughput quantification of the transcriptome and surface antigens in ORF-engineered T-cells. The top-ranked ORF, lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR), is typically expressed in myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes. When overexpressed in T-cells, LTBR induced profound transcriptional and epigenomic remodelling, increasing T-cell effector functions, as well as resistance to exhaustion in chronic stimulation settings, via constitutive activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. LTBR and other top-ranked genes improved antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and gamma delta T-cell responses, highlighting their potential for future cancer-agnostic therapies5. Our results provide several strategies for improving next generation T-cell therapies via induction of new synthetic cell programmes.","Screen data: Primary T cells from three donors were transduced with a DNA barcoded ORF library. Best proliferating cells after restimulated were sorted and barcode abundance was compared to unsorted population.

Barcoded hashing antibodies were added for sample identification and overloading. Additionally, barcoded anti-NGFR antibody was added. In addition to transcriptome and TCR sequencing, direct ORF capture was performed.

This study sought to clarify TNFR2 signaling in human Tregs using amplicon sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess Tregs treated with a TNFR2 agonist antibody. Pathway enrichment analysis based on differentially expressed genes highlighted tumor necrosis factor α signaling via nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-2 signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 signaling, interferon-γ response, and cell proliferation-related pathways in Tregs after TNFR2 activation. TNFR2-high Treg-focused analysis found that these pathways were fully activated in cancer Tregs, showing high TNFR2 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that TNFR2 orchestrates multiple pathways in cancer Tregs, which could help cancer cells escape immune surveillance, making TNFR2 signaling a potential anticancer therapy target.",Examination of gene expression profile in Treg treated with TNFR2 agonist antibody.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Muraki Y;Sato S;Okuzono Y,810466322618,Japan,GSM5606976;GSM5606977;GSM5606978;GSM5606979;GSM5606980,"Jan 10, 2022","Oct 01, 2021","Jan 13, 2022"
GSE192708,Well-paired-seq: a Size-exclusion and Locally Quasi-static Hydrodynamic Microwell Chip for Single-cell RNA-seq,,"High throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology for revealing new cell types and cellular states. However, the existing droplet or well-based methods are primarily based on the stochastic pairing of single cells and barcoded beads, resulting in a large number of empty microreactors and a low cell/bead utilization efficiency. Here, we present Well-paired-seq, consisting of thousands of size-exclusion and quasi-static hydrodynamic dual wells to address these limitations. The size-exclusion based dual-well structure allowed one cell and one bead to be trapped in the bottom well (cell-capture-well) and the top well (bead-capture-well), respectively, while the quasi-static hydrodynamic principle ensured that the trapped cells were unable to escape from cell-capture-wells, achieving cumulative capture of cells and buffer exchange in the Well-paired-seq chip. By the integration of quasi-static hydrodynamic and size-exclusion principles, the structure of the dual-well ensures one cell and one bead pairing with high density, acheiving high efficiency of cell/bead pairings (~80%) and low cell doublets.  The high utilization of microreactors and single cells/beads enable us to achieve an ultra-high throughput (~105 cells ) with low collision rates (6.2%). We demonstrate the technical performance of Well-paired-seq by collecting transcriptome data from around 200,000 cells across 21 samples including various cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and drug-treated cells, successfully revealing the heterogeneity of single cells and showing the wide applicability of Well-paired-seq for basic or clinical biomedical research.","mRNA profiles of K562/3T3 mixing, five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, PBMCs, and vorinostat-exposed A549",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,HiSeq X Ten (Homo sapiens),Yin K;Zhao M;Lin L;Song J;Yang C,Xiamen University,China,GSM5761457;GSM5761458;GSM5761459;GSM5761460;GSM5761461;GSM5761462;GSM5761463;GSM5761464;GSM5761465;GSM5761466;GSM5761467;GSM5761468;GSM5761469;GSM5761470;GSM5761471;GSM5761472;GSM5761473;GSM5761474;GSM5761475;GSM5761476;GSM5761477,"Jan 04, 2022","Dec 28, 2021","Jan 04, 2022"

These results demonstrate mux-seq as a systematic approach to characterize cellular composition, identify transcriptional signatures, and annotate genetic variants associated with SLE.",Examination of 1.2 million PBMCs in 162 SLE donors and 99 healthy individuals to find cellular and genetic correlates of SLE.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Perez RK;Gordon MG;Subramaniam M;Kim MC;Hartoularos G;Targ S;Sun Y;Ogorodnikov A;Bueno R;Lu A;Thompson M;Rappoport N;Dahl A;Lanata CM;Matloubian M;Maliskova L;Kwek SS;Li T;Slyper M;Rozenblatt-Rosen O;Fong L;Dall’era M;Balliu B;Regev A;Yazdany J;Criswell L;Zaitlen N;Ye CJ,UCSF,USA,GSM5288728;GSM5288729;GSM5288730;GSM5288731;GSM5288732;GSM5288733;GSM5288734;GSM5288735;GSM5288736;GSM5288737;GSM5288738;GSM5288739;GSM5288740;GSM5288741;GSM5288742;GSM5288743;GSM5288744;GSM5288745;GSM5288746;GSM5288747;GSM5288748;GSM5288749;GSM5288750;GSM5288751;GSM5288752;GSM5288753;GSM5288754;GSM5288755;GSM5288756;GSM5288757;GSM5288758;GSM5288759;GSM5288760;GSM5288761;GSM5288762;GSM5288763;GSM5288764;GSM5288765;GSM5288766;GSM5288767;GSM5288768;GSM5288769;GSM5288770;GSM5288771;GSM5288772;GSM5288773;GSM5288774;GSM5288775;GSM5288776;GSM5288777;GSM5288778;GSM5288779;GSM5288780;GSM5288781;GSM5288782;GSM5288783;GSM5288784;GSM5288785;GSM5288786;GSM5288787;GSM5288788;GSM5288789;GSM5288790;GSM5288791;GSM5288792;GSM5288793;GSM5288794;GSM5288795;GSM5288796;GSM5288797;GSM5288798;GSM5288799;GSM5288800;GSM5288801;GSM5288802;GSM5288803;GSM5288804;GSM5288805;GSM5288806;GSM5288807;GSM5288808;GSM5288809;GSM5288810;GSM5288811;GSM5288812;GSM5288813;GSM5288814;GSM5288815,"Dec 01, 2021","May 10, 2021","Oct 24, 2022"
GSE162632,Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals pervasive but highly cell type-specific genetic ancestry effects on the response to viral infection,34822289,"Humans show remarkable variation in susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. This heterogeneity arises partially from variation in the immune response, which is responsible for preventing and controlling infection. To better understand the major factors driving antiviral immune response differences, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to measure the effects of genetic ancestry and cis-regulatory variation on the transcriptional response to influenza infection in various immune cell types in 90 European and African American individuals. We show that monocytes are the most responsive to infection but that all cell types engage a conserved, type I IFN response, which is stronger in European individuals. Further, we detect directional, polygenic differences in expression phenotypes between populations that are under cis-genetic control and show that recent positive selection has acted on putatively causal risk loci associated with common autoimmune disorders. Our findings establish genetic ancestry and common cis-regulatory variants as important determinants governing the antiviral immune response, thus improving our understanding of the factors that contribute to differences in infectious and complex disease susceptibility.",Multiplexed single-cell RNA expression profiles of control (mock-infected) and influenza A virus (IAV)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from African and European American individuals,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Randolph HE;Fiege JK;Thielen BK;Cobb MS;Batista-Barroso J;Langlois RA;Barreiro LB,University of Chicago,USA,GSM4955739;GSM4955740;GSM4955741;GSM4955742;GSM4955743;GSM4955744;GSM4955745;GSM4955746;GSM4955747;GSM4955748;GSM4955749;GSM4955750;GSM4955751;GSM4955752;GSM4955753;GSM4955754;GSM4955755;GSM4955756;GSM4955757;GSM4955758;GSM4955759;GSM4955760;GSM4955761;GSM4955762;GSM4955763;GSM4955764;GSM4955765;GSM4955766;GSM4955767;GSM4955768;GSM5145090;GSM5145091;GSM5145092;GSM5145093;GSM5145094;GSM5145095;GSM5145096;GSM5145097;GSM5145098;GSM5145099;GSM5145100;GSM5145101;GSM5145102;GSM5145103;GSM5145104;GSM5145105;GSM5145106;GSM5145107;GSM5145108;GSM5145109;GSM5145110;GSM5145111;GSM5145112;GSM5145113;GSM5145114;GSM5145115;GSM5145116;GSM5145117;GSM5145118;GSM5145119;GSM5145120;GSM5145121;GSM5145122;GSM5145123;GSM5145124;GSM5145125;GSM5145126;GSM5145127;GSM5145128;GSM5145129;GSM5145130;GSM5145131;GSM5145132;GSM5145133;GSM5145134;GSM5145135;GSM5145136;GSM5145137;GSM5145138;GSM5145139;GSM5145140;GSM5145141;GSM5145142;GSM5145143;GSM5145144;GSM5145145;GSM5145146;GSM5145147;GSM5145148;GSM5145149;GSM5145150;GSM5145151;GSM5145152;GSM5145153;GSM5145154;GSM5145155;GSM5145156;GSM5145157;GSM5145158;GSM5145159;GSM5145160;GSM5145161;GSM5145162;GSM5145163;GSM5145164;GSM5145165;GSM5145166;GSM5145167;GSM5145168;GSM5145169;GSM5145170;GSM5145171;GSM5145172;GSM5145173;GSM5149277;GSM5149278;GSM5149279;GSM5149280;GSM5149281;GSM5149282;GSM5149283;GSM5149284;GSM5149285;GSM5149286;GSM5149287;GSM5149288;GSM5149289;GSM5149290;GSM5149291;GSM5149292;GSM5149293;GSM5149294;GSM5149295;GSM5149296;GSM5149297;GSM5149298;GSM5149299;GSM5149300;GSM5149301;GSM5149302;GSM5149303;GSM5149304;GSM5149305;GSM5149306;GSM5149307;GSM5149308;GSM5149309;GSM5149310;GSM5149311;GSM5149312;GSM5149313;GSM5149314;GSM5149315;GSM5149316;GSM5149317;GSM5149318;GSM5149319;GSM5149320;GSM5149321;GSM5149322;GSM5149323;GSM5149324;GSM5149325;GSM5149326;GSM5149327;GSM5149328;GSM5149329;GSM5149330;GSM5149331;GSM5149332;GSM5149333;GSM5149334;GSM5149335;GSM5149336;GSM5149337;GSM5149338;GSM5149339;GSM5149340;GSM5149341;GSM5149342;GSM5149343;GSM5149344;GSM5149345;GSM5149346;GSM5149347;GSM5149348;GSM5149349;GSM5149350;GSM5149351;GSM5149352;GSM5149353;GSM5149354;GSM5149355;GSM5149356;GSM5149357;GSM5149358;GSM5149359;GSM5149360;GSM5149361;GSM5149362;GSM5149363;GSM5149364;GSM5149365;GSM5149366;GSM5149367;GSM5149368;GSM5149369;GSM5149370;GSM5149371;GSM5149372;GSM5149373;GSM5149374;GSM5149375;GSM5149376;GSM5149377;GSM5149378;GSM5149379;GSM5149380;GSM5149381;GSM5149382;GSM5149383;GSM5149384;GSM5149385;GSM5149386;GSM5149387;GSM5149388;GSM5149389;GSM5149390;GSM5149391;GSM5149392;GSM5149393;GSM5149394;GSM5149395;GSM5149396;GSM5149397;GSM5149398;GSM5149399;GSM5149400;GSM5149401;GSM5149402;GSM5149403;GSM5149404;GSM5149405;GSM5149406;GSM5149407;GSM5149408;GSM5149409;GSM5149410;GSM5149411;GSM5149412;GSM5149413;GSM5149414;GSM5149415;GSM5149416;GSM5149417;GSM5149418;GSM5149419;GSM5149420;GSM5149421;GSM5149422;GSM5149423;GSM5149424;GSM5149425;GSM5149426;GSM5149427;GSM5149428;GSM5149429;GSM5149430;GSM5149431;GSM5149432;GSM5149433;GSM5149434;GSM5149435;GSM5149436;GSM5149437;GSM5149438;GSM5149439;GSM5149440;GSM5149441;GSM5149442;GSM5149443;GSM5149444;GSM5149445;GSM5149446;GSM5149447;GSM5149448;GSM5149449;GSM5149450;GSM5149451;GSM5149452;GSM5149453;GSM5149454,"Nov 26, 2021","Dec 03, 2020","Nov 10, 2022"

GSE188429,Allelic variation in Class I HLA determines pre-existing memory responses to SARS-CoV-2 that shape the CD8+ T cell repertoire upon viral exposure,34793243,"Effective presentation of antigens by HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T cells is required for viral elimination and generation of long-term immunological memory. In this study, we applied a single-cell, multi-omic technology to generate the first unified ex vivo characterization of the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 across 4 major HLA class I alleles. We found that HLA genotype conditions key features of epitope specificity, TCR a/b sequence diversity, and the utilization of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive memory T cell pools. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed functionally diverse T cell phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, associated with both disease stage and epitope specificity.

Most approaches in this area rely on oligonucleotide barcode-conjugated antibodies that target cell surface epitopes of interest, enabling their concomitant detection with the transcriptome. However, a similar high-throughput measurement of other cellular modalities such as the epigenome in concert with protein levels have not been described. Moreover, detection of epitopes is limited to antigens for which a specific antibody is available. Here, we introduce PHAGE-ATAC, an approach that enables the scalable and simultaneous detection of protein levels and chromatin accessibility data in single cells using the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Quantitative detection of proteins by PHAGE-ATAC is accomplished through the use of engineerable nanobody-displaying phages that are genetically barcoded within the nanobody-encoding phagemids. We demonstrate the utility of PHAGE-ATAC for multimodal single cell genomic analysis in both cell lines and primary human cells. Analogous to phage display approaches, we further establish a synthetic high-complexity library of nanobody-displaying phages and demonstrate its utility to select novel antigen-specific nanobodies for PHAGE-ATAC.","Human PBMCs were stained with Phages displaying anti-CD4, CD8, or CD16 nanobodies to quantify protein abundances along side accessible chromatin using scATAC-seq",Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Fiškin E;Lareau C,Memorial Sloan Kettering,USA,GSM4766872;GSM4766873;GSM4766874;GSM4766875,"Oct 21, 2021","Sep 04, 2020","Jan 20, 2022"

The fraction of T cells expressing high CAR levels was in concordance with flow cytometry results. More than 97% of the cells hit by CD8-LV expressed the CD8A gene. Remarkably, the majority of the potential off-target cells were in fact on-target cells resulting in a target cell selectivity of above 99%. Beyond that, the differential gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of restriction factors in CAR-negative cells thus explaining their protection from CAR gene transfer.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a well-characterized cytokine that has been shown to enhance human Treg cell survival and expansion at low doses in vivo. Therefore, a Phase 1 study (NCT02772679-TILT trial) was conducted combining a single infusion of autologous polyclonal Tregs, expanded ex vivo, followed by one or two 5-day courses of recombinant human low dose IL-2 (ld-IL-2) at 0.3 x 10^6 to 1 x 10^6 units/dose. The infusions had an acceptable safety profile, but all 9 patients failed to maintain C-peptide production at pre-treatment levels.Results: Single cell gene expression analysis revealed that the combination therapy led to a transient increase in the number of infused and endogenous Tregs but also resulted in a significant increase from baseline in a subset of activated NK, Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and clonal CD8+ T populations from populations","CD45+ cells were isolated by FACS, combined into 30 pools and sequenced into three distinct batches.

GSE175480,Vemurafenib acts as molecular switch in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis,,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplasm marked by the accumulation of CD1a+CD207+ cells. It is most commonly driven by a somatic activating mutation in the BRAF kinase (BRAFV600E). Multisystem disease with risk-organ involvement requires intensive chemotherapy, making BRAF-inhibitors an attractive option. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the course of an LCH patient treated with the combination of vemurafenib with salvage chemotherapy who achieved complete clinical and molecular remission. We conclusively show that there is no relationship between blood-BRAF levels and clinical presentation during treatment with vemurafenib, but that vemurafenib leads to a fast, efficient, but reversible inhibition of clinical manifestations of high-risk LCH such as cytopenia, fever, and hypoproteinemia. In line, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines exactly mirror vemurafenib administration. Genotyping for the BRAFV600E mutation shows its presence in multiple hematopoietic cell types, including NK cells and granulocytes. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells at time of diagnosis and during treatment indicate that RAF-inhibition abrogates the expression of inflammatory cytokines previously implicated in LCH. Together, our data suggest that while the CD1a+CD207+ histiocytes are the hallmark of LCH, other BRAF-mutated cells themselves contribute significantly to morbidity in patients with multisystem LCH.",Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells at time of diagnosis and during RAF-inhibition>>>Submitter states that raw data are unavailable due to patient privacy concerns<<<,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Eder SK;Schwentner R;Ben Soussia P;Abagnale G;Halbritter F;Minkov M;Attarbaschi A;Hutter C,Children's Cancer Research Institute,Austria,GSM5335177;GSM5335178;GSM5335179;GSM5335180,"Sep 23, 2021","May 24, 2021","Sep 25, 2021"

How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC is not fully understood, and its influence on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we provide an in-depth analysis of transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and perform a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alteration of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we find activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.","Single-cell expression profiling of the liver metastases of CRC in treatment patients and untreated patients.For data usage terms and conditions, please contact the principle investigator (Jianming Li, pathologylee@126.com).",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Li J;Che L,Sun Yat sen university,China,GSM5387660;GSM5387661;GSM5387662;GSM5387663;GSM5387664;GSM5387665;GSM5387666;GSM5387667;GSM5387668;GSM5387669;GSM5387670;GSM5387671;GSM5387672;GSM5387673;GSM5387674,"Sep 10, 2021","Jun 16, 2021","Sep 20, 2021"

Mononuclear cells from the decidua basalis and parietalis, and control PBMCs, were analyzed via flow cytometry to investigate MAIT cells in the decidua and assess their transcription factor expression. In a separate study, both decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells were analyzed using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) coupled with gene expression analysis. Lastly, decidual MAIT cells were stimulated with E. coli and expression of MR1 by antigen presenting cells was measured to evaluate decidual MAIT cell function.Results: First, we identified MAIT cells in both the decidua basalis and parietalis. CITE-seq, coupled with scRNAseq gene expression analysis, highlighted transcriptional programming differences between decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells at a single cell resolution. Transcription factor expression analysis further highlighted transcriptional differences between decidual MAIT cells and non-matched peripheral MAIT cells. Functionally, MAIT cells are skewed towards IFNg and TNFa production upon stimulation, with E. coli leading to IFNg production. Lastly, we demonstrate that MR1, the antigen presenting molecule restricting MAIT cells, is expressed by decidual APCs.Conclusion: MAIT cells are present in the decidua basalis and obtain a unique gene expression profile. The presence of MR1 on APCs coupled with in vitro activation by E. coli suggests that MAIT cells might be involved in tissue-repair mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface.",CD3+ T cells were obtained from matched decidua basalis and peripheral blood samples from three individuals and submitted for single cell RNA and antibody capture sequencing.

GSE167916,Protein kinase C (PKC)-independent signaling pathways regulate P-TEFb biogenesis in CD4+ T cells to reverse HIV latency,34529720,"The switch between HIV latency and productive transcription is regulated by an auto-feedback mechanism initiated by the viral trans-activator Tat, which functions to recruit the host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb to proviral HIV. A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits, P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in latently infected memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability for proviral transcription are not well-defined. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we sought to identify specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb, defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Unexpectedly, cellular treatment with diacylglycerol-mimicking protein kinase C (PKC) agonists in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore was sufficient to stimulate active P-TEFb expression and reactivate latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that of the four known isoforms of RasGRP, the diacylglycerol-dependent Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed isoform in memory CD4+ T cells and should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2 pathway alongside the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and strongly suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore, contrary to prevailing models, the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells in response to either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is largely independent of PKC activity but rather primarily involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade namely RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2.","Approximately 1.0 X 10^7 memory CD4+ T cells were routinely isolated by negative bead selection from previously frozen healthy donor leukapheresis packs containing 1.0 X 10^8 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the EasySepTM CD4+ T-cell enrichment kit (StemCell). After isolation cells were allowed to recover overnight in complete RPMI media lacking IL-2.

Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed, and 20 mg/kg was established as the recommended phase II dose.  The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was febrile neutropenia.  Among 17 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 53%, all complete remissions.  Phospho-proteomic mass cytometry showed potent on-target suppression of p-MET after ficlatuzumab and that attenuation of p-S6 was associated with clinical response.  Multiplexed single cell RNA sequencing using longitudinally collected patient specimens identified interferon and MYC target genes as adverse predictive factors.  The ficlatuzumab and cytarabine combination is well-tolerated with favorable efficacy.  High-dimensional analyses at single-cell resolution represent promising approaches for identifying biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance in prospective clinical studies.",10x Chromium based single cell RNA sequencing was performed on samples from 11 patients with refractory AML treated with ficlatuzumab and one normal control.  57 samples collected prospectively over 5 timepoints were pooled and run in 10 separate reactions.

GSE182536,single-cell RNA-sequencing on human naïve and memory CD4+ T cells during Plasmodium falciparum infection,,"Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria causes high rates of morbidity and mortality and lacks an effective vaccine. Clinical immunity develops in residents of malaria endemic regions which confers reduced clinical symptoms during infection and protects against severe disease. We hypothesized that understanding the immune mechanisms of clinical immunity could inform vaccine design to improve efficacy. We compared the peripheral blood cellular and humoral immune responses during Pf malaria infection between clinically susceptible and protected participants from a malaria endemic region in Malawi during a prospective 18-month longitudinal study. Participant classifications were defined by the number of recurrent clinical malaria episodes with susceptible participants having more than three while protected less than one episode during the study period. Protected participants exhibited higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) breadth and titers against Pf antigens, and greater antibody (Ab)-dependent Pf opsonization compared to susceptible participants, consistent with our classifications. Using high dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and spectral flow cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identified expanded memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes in the blood of protected participants undergoing malaria infection. These cells express a strong cytolytic T helper 1 effector program with transcripts encoding granzymes (A, B, H, M), granulysin, NKG7 and the ZEB2 master transcriptional regulator of terminally differentiated effector T cells. ZEB2+ memory CD4+ T cells were CD39hiTIGIThi and expressed multiple chemotactic and inhibitory receptors. Yet, their levels of several chemokine and checkpoint inhibitory receptors were reduced in protected compared to susceptible individuals.

The clinical success of these inhibitors is largely attributed to well-defined tumor-intrinsic cytostatic mechanisms, while their emerging role as immunomodulatory agents is less understood. Using integrated epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we demonstrated a novel action of CDK4/6 inhibitors in promoting the phenotypic and functional acquisition of immunological T cell memory. Short-term priming with a CDK4/6 inhibitor promoted long-term endogenous anti-tumor T cell immunity in mice,  enhanced the persistence and therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, and induced an RB-dependent T cell phenotype supportive of favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma patients.

AMULET detects had high multiplets with an estimated precision (estimated via donor-based multiplexing) and high recall (estimated via simulated doublets) compared to alternatives 0.57 precision and achieves 0.85 recall. When and was the most effective when a certain read depth is achieved (a certain read depth per nucleus is achieved samples are sequenced deeply (e.g., median read count per nucleus >20K25K) reads per nucleus in PBMCs), ATAC-DoubletDetector captured 85% of simulated doublets (i.e., recall), significantly outperforming ArchR (24%). For lower read depth, ATAC-DoubletDetector and ArchR produced complementary results. Moreover, ATAC-DoubletDetector was equally effective in identifying homotypic multiplets (i.e., multiplets from the same cell type), which are missed by simulation-based methods. Cell-specific marker peaks enabled accurate (85%) tracing of cellular origins of snATAC-seq multiplets. Accordingly, more abundant cells within a tissue are more likely to form multiplets and the majority of multiplets are homotypic. ATAC-DoubletDetector is a fast and effective multiplet detection/annotation tool for improved single cell epigenomic data analyses across diverse biological systems and conditions.",ATAC-seq reads of human pancreatic islet single cells from 1 male and 1 female donor.

GSE176022,Distinct transcriptional programs characterize neoantigen-specific T cells in   lung cancers treated with neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade [bulk TCR-seq],34290408,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment, but most patients do not respond. PD-1 blockade “unleashes” CD8 T cells, including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumor microenvironment can inhibit responses by dampening MANA-specific T cell function. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics are revealing global T cell dysfunction programs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the vast majority of TIL do not recognize tumor antigens and little is known about transcriptional programs of true MANA-specific TIL. Here, we use an integrated approach to identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells (MANAFEST) assay in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers and use their TCR CDR3 as barcodes to track them and analyze their transcriptional programs and function in the tumor microenvironment using single cell RNA sequencing. We find both MANA-and virus-specific clones in TIL and adjacent normal lung, regardless of response status. MANA-specific, influenza (flu)-specific and EBV-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Most MANA-specific clones are tissue resident memory (TRM) cells, an incompletely activated cytolytic program, including EOMES deficiency, and higher levels of genes encoding T cell inhibitory molecules and Tox2. Notably, MANA-specific T cells express low levels of IL-7R and are functionally less responsive to IL-7 compared with tissue-resident flu-specific clones. MANA-specific clones from anti-PD-1 non-responding tumors express TCR with markedly lower ligand-dependent signaling capability, are largely confined to HOBIThi TRM subsets and coordinately up-regulate genes encoding specific checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors, and intracellular inhibitors of T cell activation and cytotoxicity. These findings provide mechanistic and potential therapeutic insights into overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.",We utilized peripheral blood and surgical resection specimens obtained from the first-in-human clinical trial of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02259621).

However, pathogenesis about IgA deposition and end-stage renal failure is still not well defined. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identified the mesangial membrane receptor for IgA, which collaborates with increased extracellular matrix proteins and protease inhibitor to facilitate IgA deposition. Meanwhile, cell-cell interaction analysis revealed increased communications between mesangium and other cell types, uncovering how morbidity inside glomerulus spreads to whole kidney, which results in the genetic changes of kidney resident immune cells. Prominent interaction decreasing in intercalated cells leads to the discovery of a transitional cell type, which exhibited significant EMT and fibrosis features. Our work comprehensively characterized the pathological mesangial signatures, highlighting the step-by-step pathogenic process of IgA nephropathy from mesangium to epithelium.","In this study, we collected single cells from 13 IgAN patients’ renal biopsies and normal renal cells from 6 kidney cancer patients’ paracancerous tissues.

GSE172225,Single Cell Immunophenotyping of Lyme Erythema Migrans (Bulk TCR Repertoire Sequencing),34061047,"Erythema migrans (EM) is a skin lesion caused by the spirochete B. burgdorferi (Bb) and is a hallmark initial sign of Lyme disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells and innate immune cells mediate local inflammatory cytokine production that promote the reaction. Despite the established importance of B cells and antibodies in preventing Bb infection and resolving disease, the role of B cells in the skin immune response to Bb is incompletely defined. In this study, we characterized the immunophenotype of EM lesions and used single cell RNA-Seq to investigate B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in the EM skin lesions and peripheral blood of patients with Lyme disease. We hypothesized that B cells from the circulation, potentially primed by exposure to Bb antigens in regional draining lymph nodes, are recruited into EM lesions and play an active role in the local response to infection. We found that B cells are more abundant in the EM lesion in comparison to autologous uninvolved skin and possess distinct characteristics, including abundant expression of MHCII genes and preferential IgM isotype usage. A subset exhibited low levels of somatic hypermutation despite a gene expression profile more consistent with memory than naïve B cell subsets. Moreover, infiltrating B cells were clonally expanded and a large fraction could be directly traced to circulating relatives. By leveraging single cell gene expression with paired BCR and TCR repertoire sequencing, we demonstrate, for the first time, that B cells are recruited to the skin infection site in early Lyme disease and express a phenotype suggesting that they could play a role in local antigen presentation and antibody production.","Bulk TCR sequencing was performed on PBMCs from six subjects, all with confirmed cases of Lyme disease.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens),Melillo T;Jiang R;Meng H;Kleinstein SH;Bockenstedt LK,Yale University,USA,GSM5244384;GSM5244385;GSM5244386;GSM5244387;GSM5244388;GSM5244389,"Jun 07, 2021","Apr 16, 2021","Mar 16, 2023"

In this study, we characterized the immunophenotype of EM lesions and used single cell RNA-Seq to investigate B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in the EM skin lesions and peripheral blood of patients with Lyme disease. We hypothesized that B cells from the circulation, potentially primed by exposure to Bb antigens in regional draining lymph nodes, are recruited into EM lesions and play an active role in the local response to infection. We found that B cells are more abundant in the EM lesion in comparison to autologous uninvolved skin and possess distinct characteristics, including abundant expression of MHCII genes and preferential IgM isotype usage. A subset exhibited low levels of somatic hypermutation despite a gene expression profile more consistent with memory than naïve B cell subsets. Moreover, infiltrating B cells were clonally expanded and a large fraction could be directly traced to circulating relatives. By leveraging single cell gene expression with paired BCR and TCR repertoire sequencing, we demonstrate, for the first time, that B cells are recruited to the skin infection site in early Lyme disease and express a phenotype suggesting that they could play a role in local antigen presentation and antibody production.","Six subjects were studied, all with confirmed cases of Lyme Disease.

The unbiased profiling of immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment may reveal immunologic networks affecting therapy and course of disease. Here we identify and validate the presence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within tumor tissues that are positively linked to glioblastoma malignancy. In contrast to the medullary hematopoietic compartment, tumor-associated HSPCs are comprised of a majority of CD38- immature cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors, express genes related to glioblastoma progression and display patterns of accelerated cell cycle. When cultured ex vivo, tumor-associated HSPCs form prevalently myeloid colonies, suggesting potential in situ myelopoiesis. In experimental models, HSPCs promote tumor cell proliferation, expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and secretion of tumor promoting cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2, indicating concomitant support of both malignancy and immunosuppression. Additionally, the frequency of tumor-associated HSPCs is prognostic for patient survival and correlate with immunosuppressive phenotypes.

CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified NCOR1 and HDAC3 transcriptional co-repressors as the principle antagonists of P300/CBP by counteracting acetylation turnover kinetics. Finally, deacetylation of H3K27 provides nucleation sites for reciprocal methylation switching, a feature that can be exploited therapeutically by concomitant KDM6A and P300 inhibition.

GSE172495,SINGLE-CELL CHARACTERIZATION OF A MODEL OF POLY I:C-STIMULATED PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS IN SEVERE ASTHMA,33902571,"Background: Asthma has been associated with impaired interferon response. Multiple cell types have been implicated in such response impairment and may be responsible for asthma immunopathology. However, existing models to study the immune response in asthma are limited by bulk profiling of cells. Our objective was to Characterize a model of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with severe asthma (SA) and its response to the TLR3 agonist Poly I:C using two single-cell methods.   Methods: Two complementary single-cell methods, DropSeq for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), were used to profile PBMCs of SA patients and healthy controls (HC). Poly I:C-stimulated and unstimulated cells were analyzed in this study.   Results: PBMCs (n=9,414) from five SA (n=6,099) and three HC (n=3,315) were profiled using scRNA-Seq. Six main cell subsets, namely CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes, were identified. CD4+ T cells were the main cell type in SA and demonstrated a pro-inflammatory profile characterized by increased JAK1 expression. Following Poly I:C stimulation, PBMCs from SA had a robust induction of interferon pathways compared with HC. CyTOF profiling of Poly I:C stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs (n=160,000) from the same individuals (SA=5; HC=3) demonstrated higher CD8+ and CD8+ effector T cells in SA at baseline, followed by a decrease of CD8+ effector T cells after poly I:C stimulation.  Conclusions: Single-cell profiling of an in vitro model using PBMCs in patients with SA identified activation of pro-inflammatory pathways at baseline and strong response to Poly I:C, as well as quantitative changes in CD8+ effector cells. Thus, transcriptomic and cell quantitative changes are associated with immune cell heterogeneity in this model to evaluate interferon responses in severe asthma.",PBMCs from five patients with severe asthma and three healthy controls were compared at baseline and following poly (I:C) stimulation.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens),Gomez J,Yale University,USA,GSM5257967;GSM5257968;GSM5257969;GSM5257970;GSM5257971;GSM5257972;GSM5257973;GSM5257974;GSM5257975;GSM5257976;GSM5257977;GSM5257978;GSM5257979;GSM5257980;GSM5257981;GSM5257982,"Apr 22, 2021","Apr 21, 2021","Nov 16, 2021"

The importance of these platforms in clinical and translational studies led us to investigate the impact of delayed blood processing on the numbers and state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the plasma proteome. Similar to previous studies, we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMCs up to 18 hours. In contrast, profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology. Differences accumulating during an overnight rest (18 hours) could confound relevant biologic variance related to many underlying disease states.","To study the effects of delays in PBMC processing from whole blood we performed two similar but independent experiments. In Experiment 1, we isolated PBMC from whole blood at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 18 hours after blood draw from healthy donors (n=3) or those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=3).

GSE169503,Identification and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell response with immunodominant features,33972535,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a continuous challenge worldwide, and there is an urgent need to map the landscape of immunogenic and immunodominant epitopes recognized by CD8 T cells. Here, we analyze samples from 31 COVID-19 patients for CD8 T cell recognition of 500 peptide-HLA class I complexes, restricted by 10 common HLA alleles. We identify 18 CD8 T cell recognized SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, including an epitope with immunodominant features derived from ORF1ab and restricted by HLA-A*01:01. In-depth characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses of patients with acute critical and severe disease reveals high expression of NKG2A, lack of cytokine production and a gene expression profile inhibiting T cell re-activation and migration while sustaining survival. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses are detectable up to 5 months post recovery from critical and severe disease, and these responses convert from dysfunctional effector to functional memory CD8 T cells during convalescence.","Single-cell RNA sequencing (incl. TCRseq) using the 10x Genomics Chromium system (5' kit) was performed on CD8 T cells from 6 COVID-19 patients with acute severe and critical disease.

GSE168453,Longitudinal single-cell epitope and RNA-sequencing reveals the immunological impact of type 1 interferon autoantibodies in critical COVID-19,33758859,"Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies have been found in some critical COVID-19 patients; however, their prevalence and longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale, and functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown. Here, in 284 COVID-19 patients, we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical, 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single- cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.","Multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA and epitope sequencing from 79 individuals: 54 COVID positive patients, 15 COVID negative patients, and 11 healthy controls.

GSE167823,The memory B cell response to influenza vaccination is impaired in older persons,,"Influenza imparts an age-related increase in mortality and morbidity. The most effective countermeasure is vaccination; however, vaccines offer modest protection in older adults. To investigate how ageing impacts the memory B cell response we tracked haemagglutinin specific B cells by indexed flow sorting and single cell RNA sequencing in twenty healthy adults administered the trivalent influenza vaccine. We found age-related skewing in the memory B cell compartment six weeks after vaccination, with younger adults developing haemagglutinin specific memory B cells with an FCRL5+ “atypical” phenotype, showing evidence of somatic hypermutation and positive selection, which happened to a lesser extent in older persons. We confirmed the germinal center ancestry of these FCRL5+ “atypical” memory B cells using scRNASeq from fine needle aspirates of influenza responding human lymph nodes and paired blood samples. Together, this study shows that the aged human germinal center reaction and memory B cell response following vaccination is defective.","Plate based SMART-Seq single cell RNA sequencing of index flow

GSE167363,Dynamic changes in human single cell transcriptional signatures during fatal sepsis,34558746,"Systemic infections, especially in patients with chronic diseases, result in sepsis: an explosive, uncoordinated immune response that can lead to multisystem organ failure with a high mortality rate. Sepsis survivors and non-survivors oftentimes have similar clinical phenotypes or sepsis biomarker expression upon diagnosis, suggesting that the dynamics of sepsis in the critical early stage may have an impact on these opposite outcomes. To investigate this, we designed a within-subject study of patients with systemic gram-negative bacterial sepsis with surviving and fatal outcomes and performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected during the critical period between sepsis recognition and 6 hours. We observed that the largest sepsis-induced expression changes over time in surviving versus fatal sepsis were in CD14+ monocytes, including gene signatures previously reported for sepsis outcomes. We further identify changes in the metabolic pathways of both monocytes and platelets, the emergence of erythroid precursors, and T cell exhaustion signatures, with the most extreme differences occurring between the non-sepsis control and the sepsis non-survivor. Our single-cell observations are consistent with trends from public datasets but also reveal specific effects in individual immune cell populations, which change within hours. In conclusion, this pilot study provides the first single-cell results with a repeated measures design in sepsis to analyze the temporal changes in the immune cell population behavior in surviving or fatal sepsis. These findings indicate that tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell-types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes. We also identify molecular pathways that could be therapeutically controlled to improve the sepsis trajectory toward better outcomes.","Single-cell RNA-sequencing of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heathy controls, survivor and non-survivor of gram-negative sepsis patients.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Qiu X;Li J;Bonenfant J;Jaroszewski L;Klein W;Godzik A;Nair MG,"University of California, Riverside",USA,GSM5102900;GSM5102901;GSM5102902;GSM5102903;GSM5102904;GSM5102905;GSM5511351;GSM5511352;GSM5511353;GSM5511354;GSM5511355;GSM5511356,"Mar 03, 2021","Feb 23, 2021","Sep 08, 2022"

GSE144744,Identifying CNS-colonizing T cells as potential therapeutic targets to prevent progression of multiple sclerosis,33748804,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), can be suppressed in its early stages but eventually becomes clinically progressive and unresponsive to therapy. Here we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood brain barrier.Methods: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA-sequencing we localize these cells in post-mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes).Findings: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/LTB+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients.Conclusions: As a consequence, we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression.Funding: This study was supported by funding from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft, the OAK Foundation, Medical Research Council UK and Wellcome.","In a primary cohort nine relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were sampled longitudinally with and without natalizumab treatment. Two auxiliary cross-sectional cohorts consisting of eleven untreated RRMS and ten primary-progressive MS (PPMS) patients as well as 31 matched healthy individuals for all patients were included. Taken together, we performed multi-modal immunophenotyping by scRNA-seq and surface antibody staining in a total of 71 PBMC samples from 62 donors resulting in close to half a million single cell transcriptomes and around 360,000 surface protein profiles**Raw data not provided due to patient privacy concerns**",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Kaufmann M;Evans H;Schaupp AL;Engler JB;Kaur G;Willing A;Kursawe N;Schubert C;Attfield KE;Fugger L;Friese MA,Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf,Germany,GSM4294777;GSM4294778;GSM4294779;GSM4294780;GSM4294781;GSM4294782;GSM4294783;GSM4294784;GSM4294785;GSM4294786;GSM4294787;GSM4294788;GSM4294789;GSM4294790;GSM4294791;GSM4294792;GSM4294793;GSM4294794;GSM4294795;GSM4294796;GSM4294797;GSM4294798;GSM4294799;GSM4294800;GSM4294801;GSM4294802;GSM4294803;GSM4294804;GSM4294805;GSM4294806;GSM4294807;GSM4294808;GSM4294809;GSM4294810;GSM4294811;GSM4294812;GSM4294813;GSM4294814;GSM4294815;GSM4294816;GSM4294817;GSM4294818;GSM4294819;GSM4294820;GSM4294821;GSM4294822;GSM4294823;GSM4294824;GSM4294825;GSM4294826;GSM4294827;GSM4294828;GSM4294829;GSM4294830;GSM4294831;GSM4294832;GSM4294833;GSM4294834;GSM4294835;GSM4294836;GSM4294837;GSM4294838;GSM4294839;GSM4294840;GSM4294841;GSM4294842;GSM4294843;GSM4294844;GSM4294845;GSM4294846;GSM4294847;GSM4294848;GSM4294849;GSM4294850;GSM4294851;GSM4294852;GSM4294853;GSM4294854;GSM4294855;GSM4294856;GSM4294857;GSM4294858;GSM4294859;GSM4294860;GSM4294861;GSM4294862;GSM4294863;GSM4294864;GSM4294865;GSM4294866;GSM4294867;GSM4294868;GSM4294869;GSM4294870;GSM4294871;GSM4294872;GSM4294873;GSM4294874;GSM4294875;GSM4294876;GSM4294877;GSM4294878;GSM4294879;GSM4294880;GSM4294881;GSM4294882;GSM4294883;GSM4294884;GSM4294885;GSM4294886;GSM4294887;GSM4294888;GSM4294889;GSM4294890;GSM4294891;GSM4294892;GSM4294893;GSM4294894;GSM4294895;GSM4294896;GSM4294897;GSM4294898;GSM4294899;GSM4294900;GSM4294901;GSM4294902;GSM4294903;GSM4294904;GSM4294905;GSM4294906;GSM4294907;GSM4294908;GSM4294909;GSM4294910;GSM4294911;GSM4294912;GSM4294913;GSM4294914;GSM4294915;GSM4294916;GSM4294917;GSM4294918;GSM4294919;GSM4294920;GSM4294921;GSM4294922;GSM4294923;GSM4294924;GSM4294925;GSM4294926;GSM4294927;GSM4294928;GSM4294929;GSM4294930;GSM4294931;GSM4294932;GSM4294933;GSM4294934;GSM4294935;GSM4294936;GSM4294937;GSM4294938;GSM4294939;GSM4294940;GSM4294941;GSM4294942;GSM4294943;GSM4294944;GSM4294945;GSM4294946;GSM4294947;GSM4294948;GSM4294949;GSM4294950;GSM4294951;GSM4294952;GSM4294953;GSM4294954;GSM4294955;GSM4294956;GSM4294957;GSM4294958;GSM4294959;GSM4294960;GSM4294961;GSM4294962;GSM4294963;GSM4294964;GSM4294965;GSM4294966;GSM4294967;GSM4294968;GSM4294969;GSM4294970;GSM4294971;GSM4294972;GSM4294973;GSM4294974;GSM4294975;GSM4294976;GSM4294977;GSM4294978;GSM4294979;GSM4294980,"Feb 16, 2021","Feb 04, 2020","Apr 27, 2021"
GSE161918,Time-resolved Systems Immunology Reveals a Late Juncture Linked to Fatal COVID-19,33713619,"COVID-19 exhibits extensive clinical heterogeneity ranging from asymptomatic infection to death. Unraveling the basis of immune response differences across individuals is critical for developing effective therapeutics and prophylactics. We longitudinally assessed 192 surface protein markers, the transcriptome, and T-cell receptor sequence profiles simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from COVID-19 patients, and compared to age-matched healthy control samples.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 33 COVID19 patients and 14 age-matched healthy controls were profiled using multi-modal single cell RNAseq (surface protein staining (Biolegend TotalSeq-C lyophilized panel), mRNA, and T cell recpetor VDJ regions) using the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Individual patients samples, in some cases with multiple samples per donor from different timepoints during disease, were combined and ran together in several lanes of the 10x system, and assignment of the individual cells to a donor and timepoint was done using a combination of SNP and antibody hashtags. SNP calls per donor were determined from bulk level RNAseq data of the individual samples. A single sample, CHI014, was included across the three batches as a technical control, but not used in further analysis. Additionally, a healthy control donor, SHD8, was excluded from further analysis upon finding lymphoma-like B cells in this sample; the HDML_bc and HDVO_bc samples were included to test an alternate cell freezing protocol, and also not used in further analysis.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Liu C;Martins AJ;Lau WW;Rachmaninoff N;Chen J;Imberti L;Mostaghimi D;Fink DL;Burbelo PD;Dobbs K;Delmonte OM;Bansal N;Failla L;Sottini A;Quiros-Roldan E;Han KL;Sellers BA;Cheung F;Sparks R;Chun T;Moir S;Lionakis M;Rossi C;NIAID-COVID-Consortium *;COVID-Clinicians *;Su HC;Kuhns DB;Notarangelo LD;Tsang JS,Liu et. al.

GSE151917,DNA hypomethylating agents increase activation and cytolytic activity of CD8+ T-cells,33609448,"DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) induce Type I/III interferon signaling through dsRNA-mediated viral mimicry in cancer cells. Yet, the direct effects of HMAs in immune cells remains less clear. Here, we demonstrate that HMA treatments can directly modulate the anti-tumor response and effector function of CD8+ T-cells. In vivo HMA treatment promotes CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and supresses tumor growth via CD8+ T-cell dependent activity. HMAs enhances primary human CD8+ T-cells activation markers, effector cytokine production, and anti-tumor cytolytic activity. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling shows that HMAs vastly regulate T-cell activation related transcriptional networks, culminating with over-activation of NFATc1 short-isoforms. Mechanistically, demethylation of an intragenic CpG Island immediately downstream to the 3'UTR of the short isoform was associated with anti-sense transcription and alternative polyadenylation of NFATc1 short-isoforms. High-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) analyses reveal a selective effect of HMAs on a subset of human CD8+ T-cell subpopulations, resulting in an increase in both number and abundance of a granzymeBhigh, perforinhigh effector subpopulation.

Although the activation process of normal T cells is well characterized, comparatively little is known about the activation of cells via the CAR. Here we have used flow cytometry together with single cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the starting material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells –PBMCs-) and CAR therapeutic products of 3 healthy donors in the presence and absence of antigen specific stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis of the 57,676 single cell transcriptomes showed the CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells, with the cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor, and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of the underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature, with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion. Comprehensive single cell transcriptomic analysis thus represents a powerful way to guide the assessment and optimization of clinical-grade CAR-T-cells, and inform future research into the underlying molecular processes.",To characterize CAR-T cell products,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Wang X;Peticone C;Kotsopoulou E;Göttgens B;Calero-Nieto FJ,University of Cambridge,United Kingdom,GSM4333345;GSM4333346;GSM4333347;GSM4333348;GSM4333349;GSM4333350;GSM4333351;GSM4333352;GSM4333353,"Jan 22, 2021","Feb 24, 2020","Mar 13, 2023"

GSE164378,Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data,34062119,"The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities, known as multimodal analysis, represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates new computational methods that can define cellular states based on multiple data types. Here, we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.",Human PBMCs were profiled using CITE-seq and cell hashing*** Raw data will be deposited in dbGaP due to patient privacy concerns ***,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Hao Y,New York Genome Center,USA,GSM5008737;GSM5008738;GSM5008739;GSM5008740;GSM5008741;GSM5008742;GSM5008743;GSM5008744;GSM5008745,"Jan 15, 2021","Jan 07, 2021","Jul 08, 2021"

MAIT cells are innate-like T cells involved in mucosal immunity and protection against viral infections. Here, we studied the immune cell landscape, with emphasis on MAIT cells, in cohorts of 208 patients at various stages of disease activity. MAIT cell frequency is strongly reduced in blood. They display a strong activated and cytotoxic phenotype that is more pronounced in lungs. Blood MAIT cell alterations positively correlate with other innate cell activation; pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-18; and with the severity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified a monocyte/macrophage Interferon-a-IL-18 cytokine shift and the ability of infected macrophages to induce cytotoxicity of MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. Together our results suggest that altered MAIT cell functions due to IFN-a-IL-18 imbalance contribute to disease severity and their therapeutic manipulation might prevent deleterious inflammation in COVID-19 aggravation.",MAIT cells single cell analysis from uninfected SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=4)  and infected severe cases infected SARS-CoV-patients  (n=4) .

GSE161895,Single cell RNA-seq reveals developmental plasticity with coexisting oncogenic states and immune evasion programs in ETP-ALL [Patients_TALLs_scRNA-seq],33227818,"Lineage plasticity and stemness have been invoked as the cause of therapy resistance in cancer, as these flexible states allow cancer cells to de-differentiate and alter their dependencies. We investigated such resistance mechanisms in relapsed / refractory early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying activating NOTCH1 mutations, by full-length single cell RNA sequencing of malignant and microenvironmental cells. We identified two highly distinct stem-like states that critically differ in their cell-cycle and oncogenic signaling. Fast-cycling stem-like leukemia cells demonstrate Notch activation and are effectively eliminated in patients by Notch inhibition, while slow cycling stem-like cells are Notch-independent but rather rely on PI3K signaling, likely explaining the poor efficacy of Notch inhibition in this disease. Remarkably, we find that both stem-like states can differentiate into a more mature leukemia state with prominent immune-modulatory functions, including high expression of the LGALS9 checkpoint molecule. These cells promote an immunosuppressive leukemia ecosystem with clonal accumulation of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that express HAVCR2, the cognate receptor for LGALS9. Our study identifies complex interactions between signaling programs, cellular plasticity and immune programs that characterize T-ALL and illustrates the multi-dimensionality of tumor heterogeneity. In this scenario, combination therapies targeting diverse oncogenic states and the immune ecosystem appear most promising to successfully eliminate tumor cells that escape treatment through co-existing transcriptional programs.",Single cell expression profiles of five patients with relapsed/refractory ETP-ALL and five normal donors.**Raw data not provided due to patient privacy

GSE154386,Temporally integrated single cell RNA sequencing analysis of controlled and natural DENV-1 infections,33513191,"Controlled dengue human challenge studies present a unique opportunity to address many longstanding questions in the field of flavivirus biology. These fundamental questions include defining the early immunological signatures of infection, the host/environmental factors that impact disease severity, and the role of preexisting immunity on the development of symptomatic viral infection. However, while several controlled dengue human challenge studies have been performed and appear to clinically recapitulate may features of mild natural DENV infection, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by these attenuated challenge viruses compares to the profile associated with a natural, unattenuated DENV infection. To bridge this knowledge gap, we performed scRNAseq analysis on longitudinally collected PBMC samples obtained from 3 individuals (8 time points per subject) enrolled in the SUNY/WRAIR DENV-1 controlled human challenge study. In addition, 3 time points (two acute infection time points, one control time point) from two individuals experiencing a natural DENV-1 infection were analyzed and computationally integrated with the challenge model dataset. This temporally integrated dataset contains a total of 171,208 cells and 22 statistically distinct populations corresponding to all major anticipated leukocyte subsets. While all identified cell populations demonstrated significant and consistant perturbations in their transcriptional profile in response to either natural or experimental DENV infection, conventional monocytes respond most robustly to infection across all subjects and study groups from an unbiased transcriptional perspective. Using these data, core sets of genes that were consistently induced by either natural or experimental DENV were identified, and the overlap between the two arms of the study assessed.","scRNAseq (10xGenomics Single Cell 5' v2 Reagents Kit) analysis was performed on unfractionated PBMC obtained from three DHIM-1 subjects (8 time points per subject), and two subjects with natural DENV-1 infections (3 time points per subject).",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Waickman A;Currier J,SUNY Upstate Medical University,USA,GSM4670192;GSM4670193;GSM4670194;GSM4670195;GSM4670196;GSM4670197;GSM4670198;GSM4670199;GSM4670200;GSM4670201;GSM4670202;GSM4670203;GSM4670204;GSM4670205;GSM4670206;GSM4670207;GSM4670208;GSM4670209;GSM4670210;GSM4670211;GSM4670212;GSM4670213;GSM4670214;GSM4670215;GSM4670216;GSM4670217;GSM4670218;GSM4670219;GSM4670220;GSM4670221,"Jan 01, 2021","Jul 14, 2020","Apr 02, 2021"
GSE162806,A Roadmap from Single-Cell Transcriptome to Patient Classification for the Immune Response to Trauma,33320841,"Immune dysfunction is an important factor driving mortality and adverse outcomes after trauma but remains poorly understood, especially at cellular level. To deconvolute the trauma-induced immune response, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to circulating and bone marrow mononuclear cells in injured mice and circulating mononuclear cells in trauma patients. In mice, the greatest changes in gene expression were seen in monocytes across both compartments. After systemic injury, the gene expression pattern of monocytes markedly deviated from steady state with corresponding changes in critical transcription factors (TFs), which can be traced back to myeloid progenitors. These changes were largely recapitulated in the human single-cell analysis. We generalized the major changes in human CD14+ monocytes into six signatures, which further defined two trauma patient subtypes (SG1 vs. SG2) identified in the whole blood leukocyte transcriptome in the initial 12h after injury. Compared with SG2, SG1 patients exhibited delayed recovery, more severe organ dysfunction and a higher incidence of infection and non-infectious complications. The two patient subtypes were also recapitulated in burn and sepsis patients, revealing a shared pattern of immune response across critical illness. Our data will be broadly useful to further explore the immune response to inflammatory diseases and critical illness.","We longitudinally single-cell RNA sequenced circulating and bone marrow mononuclear cells in injured mice (3hrs, 6hrs and 24hrs representing escalating, peak and recovery phase of inflammation) and circulating mononuclear cells in trauma patients (<4hrs, 24hrs and 72hrs mainly representing the early changes after systematic injury) along with paired healthy controls.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Billiar TR;Sperry JL;Namas RA;Chen K;Chen W;Vodovotz Y;Conroy J;Chen T,University of Pittsburgh,USA,GSM4960241;GSM4960242;GSM4960243;GSM4960244;GSM4960245;GSM4960246;GSM4960247;GSM4960248;GSM4960249;GSM4960250;GSM4960251;GSM4960252;GSM4960253;GSM4960254;GSM4960255;GSM4960256;GSM4960257;GSM4960258;GSM4960259;GSM4960260;GSM4960261;GSM4960262;GSM4960263;GSM4960264;GSM4960265;GSM4960266;GSM4960267;GSM4960268;GSM4960269;GSM4960270;GSM4960271;GSM4960272;GSM4960273;GSM4960274;GSM4960275;GSM4960276;GSM4960277;GSM4960278;GSM4960279;GSM4960280;GSM4960281;GSM4960282;GSM4960283;GSM4960284;GSM4960285;GSM4960286;GSM4960287;GSM4960288;GSM4960289;GSM4960290;GSM4960291;GSM4960292;GSM4960293;GSM4960294;GSM4960295;GSM4960296;GSM4960297;GSM4960298;GSM4960299;GSM4960300;GSM4960301;GSM4960302,"Dec 16, 2020","Dec 07, 2020","Dec 18, 2020"
GSE163014,Single-cell RNA sequencing of Tocilizumab-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an in vitro model of inflammation,33469465,"COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to global health. Early data has revealed that IL-6, a key regulatory cytokine, plays an  important role in the cytokine storm of COVID-19. Multiple trials are therefore looking at the effects of Tocilizumab, an IL-6  receptor antibody that inhibits IL-6 activity, on treatment of COVID-19, with promising findings. As part of a clinical trial looking  at the effects of Tocilizumab treatment on kidney transplant recipients with subclinical rejection, we performed single-cell RNA  sequencing of comparing stimulated PBMCs before and after Tocilizumab treatment. We leveraged this data to create an in vitro  cytokine storm model, to better understand the effects of Tocilizumab in the presence of inflammation. Tocilizumab-treated cells  had reduced expression of inflammatory-mediated genes and biologic pathways, particularly amongst monocytes. These results  support the hypothesis that Tocilizumab may hinder the cytokine storm of COVID-19, through a demonstration of biologic impact at  the single-cell level.","Examination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 human kidney transplant recipients, diagnosed with subclinical rejection on their 6-month post-transplant protocol biopsy and randomized to either continue standard of care (Tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and steroid) immunosuppression (control arm, 8 patients) or standard of care plus Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab treatment arm, 7 patients).",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Zarinsefat A;Hartoularos GC;Rychkov D;Rashmi P;Chandran S;Vincenti F;Ye CJ;Sarwal MM,"University of California, San Francisco",USA,GSM4970234;GSM4970235;GSM4970236;GSM4970237;GSM4970238;GSM4970239;GSM4970240;GSM4970241;GSM4970242;GSM4970243;GSM4970244;GSM4970245;GSM4970246;GSM4970247;GSM4970248;GSM4970249;GSM4970250;GSM4970251;GSM4970252;GSM4970253;GSM4970254;GSM4970255;GSM4970256;GSM4970257,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 10, 2020","Jan 27, 2021"
GSE140182,Single cell RNA sequencing of advanced gastric cancer,33277616,"To define the cellular characteristics of malignant ascites of advanced gastric cancer patients and search for therapeutic strategies, we applied single cell RNA sequencing to cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAM), present in large numbers in malignant ascites. We analyzed 180 cells from 4 malignant ascites and 1 cerebrospinal fluid metastasis. The results indicate that the anti-inflammatory characteristics of the tumor associated macrophages are concocted by the tumor cells. By constructing reference transcriptomes for M1 and M2 type macrophages, we found a strong non-inflammatory property of macrophages recovered from the malignant ascites of gastric cancer.","Total five samples were collected from four patients diagnosed as advanced gastric cancer. We obtained four peritoneal ascites and one cerebrospinal fluid (AGC04CSF). To construct reference M1 or M2 type macrophages, PBMC-derived CD14+ cells were collected from two healty donors.

GSE132338,Characterization of the immunologic impact of sarcoidosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells via single-cell RNA-seq,33363531,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by infiltration of immune cells into granulomas. Previous gene expression studies using heterogeneous cell mixtures lack insight into cell-type-specific immune dysregulation. We performed the first single-cell RNA-sequencing study of sarcoidosis in peripheral immune cells in 48 patients and controls. Following unbiased clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified for 18 cell types and bioinformatically assessed for function and pathway enrichment. Our results reveal persistent activation of circulating classical monocytes with subsequent upregulation of trafficking molecules. Specifically, classical monocytes upregulated distinct markers of activation including adhesion molecules, pattern recognition receptors, and chemokine receptors, as well as enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways HMGB1, mTOR, and ephrin receptor signaling. Predictive modeling implicated TGFβ and mTOR signaling as drivers of persistent monocyte activation. Additionally, sarcoidosis T cell subsets displayed patterns of dysregulation. CD4 naïve T cells were enriched for markers of apoptosis and Th17/Treg differentiation, while effector T cells showed enrichment of anergy-related pathways. Differentially expressed genes in regulatory T cells suggested dysfunctional p53, cell death, and TNFR2 signaling. Using more sensitive technology and more precise units of measure, we identify cell-type specific, novel inflammatory and regulatory pathways. Based on our findings, we suggest a novel model involving four convergent arms of dysregulation: persistent hyperactivation of innate and adaptive immunity via classical monocytes and CD4 naïve T cells, regulatory T cell dysfunction, and effector T cell anergy.

Here, we profile 176,447 cells from 10 NPC tumour-blood pairs, using single-cell transcriptome coupled with T cell receptor sequencing. Our analyses reveal 53 cell subtypes, including tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T, regulatory T (Treg), and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as malignant cells with different Epstein-Barr virus infection status. Trajectory analyses reveal exhausted CD8+ T and immune-suppressive TNFRSF4+ Treg cells in tumours might derive from peripheral CX3CR1+CD8+ T and naïve Treg cells, respectively. Moreover, we identify immune-regulatory and tolerogenic LAMP3+ DCs. Noteworthily, intensive inter-cell interactions are observed among LAMP3+ DCs, Treg, exhausted CD8+ T, and malignant cells, suggesting potential cross-talks to foster an immune-suppressive niche for the TME.

Assaying transposase-accessible chromatin in single cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a suitable method for revealing such networks. Thus, scATAC-seq was applied to define the landscape of active regulatory DNA in AS. As a result, there was a significant change in the percent of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs, and 37 differentially accessible transcription factor (TF) motifs were identified. T cells, monocytes-1 and dendritic cells were found to be crucial for the IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, since they had 73 potential target genes regulated by 8 TF motifs with decreased accessibility in AS. Moreover, natural killer cells were involved in AS by increasing the accessibility to TF motifs TEAD1 and JUN to induce cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. In addition, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells may be vital for altering host immune functions through increasing the accessibility of TF motifs NR1H4 and OLIG (OLIGI and OLIG2), respectively.

Together, our analyses provide so far unprecedented insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in distinct disease severities.",Single-cell RNA-seq were performed from pure populations of virus-reactive memory CD4+ T cells isolated ex vivo from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (n=40) and healthy controls (n=13).,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Meckiff B;Suastegui CR;Rosas VF;Chee SJ;Kusnadi A;Simon H;Grifoni A;Pelosi E;Sette A;Ay F;Seumois G;Ottensmeier CH;Vijayanand P,La Jolla Institute for Immunology,USA,GSM4617145;GSM4617146;GSM4617147;GSM4617148;GSM4617149;GSM4617150;GSM4617151;GSM4617152;GSM4617153;GSM4617154;GSM4617155;GSM4617156;GSM4617157;GSM4617158;GSM4617159;GSM4617160;GSM4617161;GSM4617162;GSM4617163;GSM4617164;GSM4617165;GSM4617166;GSM4617167;GSM4617168;GSM4617169;GSM4617170;GSM4617171;GSM4617172;GSM4617173;GSM4617174;GSM4617175;GSM4617176;GSM4617177;GSM4617178;GSM4617179;GSM4617180;GSM4617181;GSM4617182;GSM4617183;GSM4617184;GSM4617185;GSM4617186;GSM4617187;GSM4617188;GSM4617189;GSM4617190;GSM4617191;GSM4617192;GSM4617193;GSM4617194;GSM4617195;GSM4617196;GSM4617197;GSM4617198;GSM4617199;GSM4617200;GSM4617201;GSM4617202;GSM4617203;GSM4617204;GSM4794659;GSM4794660;GSM4794661;GSM4794662;GSM4794663;GSM4794664;GSM4794665;GSM4794666;GSM4794667;GSM4794668;GSM4794669;GSM4794670;GSM4794671;GSM4794672;GSM4794673;GSM4794674;GSM4794675;GSM4794676,"Oct 06, 2020","Jun 15, 2020","Jan 05, 2021"

GSE149313,Molecular signatures of inflammatory profile and B-cell function in SFTS patients,33593977,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome banyangvirus (SFTSV) induces immunopathogenic disease with high fatality rate. Despite serious health concern, the mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations are largely unknown. Here, we applied targeted proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics analyses to examine the differential immune landscape of SFTS patient blood. Serum immunoprofiling distinguished Low-risk and High-risk clusters of SFTS patients with differential inflammatory cytokine levels, which matched with disease severity. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of SFTS patient blood at different infection state showed pronounced expansion of B cells with the alteration of B-cell subset populations, specifically in fatal patients. Furthermore, plasma cells were the primary reservoir of SFTSV replication with the downregulation of IFN pathway. This study identifies not only the molecular signatures of serum inflammatory profile and B cell lineage population, but also plasma cells as the viral reservoir in SFTSV-induced fatal patients, suggesting the alteration of B cell function linked to SFTS lethal infection.","PBMC from Control, Infection, Recovery and Fatal SFTS patients were collected in hospitals throughout South Korea.

GSE148020,Genetic landscape and autoimmunity of monocytes in developing Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,,"Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder affecting multiple organs, including eyes, skin, and central nervous system. It is known that monocytes significantly contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. However, the subset heterogeneity with unique functions and signatures in human circulating monocytes and the identity of disease-specific monocytic populations remain largely unknown. Here, we employed an advanced single-cell RNA sequencing technology to systematically analyze 11259 human circulating monocytes and genetically defined their subpopulations. We constructed a precise atlas of human blood monocytes，identified 6 subpopulations: including S100A12-; HLA-; CD16-; proinflammatory-; megakaryocyte-like-; and NK-like-monocytes subsets, and uncovered 2 previously unidentified subsets: HLA- and megakaryocyte-like monocyte subsets. Relative to healthy individuals, cellular composition, gene expression signatures, and activation states were markedly alternated in VKH patients utilizing cell type-specific programs, especially the CD16- and proinflammatory monocyte subpopulation. Notably, we discovered a disease-relevant subgroup, proinflammatory monocytes, which showed a discriminative gene expression signature indicative of inflammation, antiviral activity, and pathologic activation, and converted into pathologic activation state implicating the active inflammation during VKH disease. Additionally, we found the cell type-specific transcriptional signature of proinflammatory monocytes, ISG15, which could act as a disease biomarker to more accurately reflect disease activity and treatment response than symptom evaluation. Taken together, in this landmark study we present novel discoveries on accurate classification, molecular markers, and signaling pathways for VKH disease-associated monocytes and therapeutically targeting this proinflammatory monocyte subpopulation would provide an attractive approach for treating VKH as well as other autoimmune diseases.",10X single cell RNA-seq from 3 normal people and 3 VHK patient,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens),Hu Y;Xiao Y,18728192414,China,GSM4452320;GSM4452321;GSM4452322;GSM4452323;GSM4452324;GSM4452325,"Sep 20, 2020","Apr 02, 2020","Sep 22, 2020"

Here we introduce INs-seq, an integrated technology for massively parallel recording of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein activity. We demonstrate the broad utility of INs-seq for reveling new immune subsets by profiling different intracellular signatures of immune signaling, transcription-factor combinations and metabolic activity. Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 1 expressing cells within tumor models, a metabolic immune signature of suppressive activity, discovers a novel Arg1+ Trem2+ regulatory myeloid cell (Mreg) and identifies markers, metabolic activity and pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice inhibits the accumulation of intra-tumoral Mreg cells, leading to a marked decrease in dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and intra-cellular maps, and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid suppressive cells in tumors.","9 different 10x experiments were done, with 20 samples in total.

While CD4 T cells have been reported in the central nervous system, their presence in the healthy brain remains controversial, and their function at this site unknown. Here we have used a combination of imaging, single cell and surgical approaches to identify a unique CD69+ CD4 T cell population in both the mouse and human brain, which is distinct from circulating CD4 T cells. The brain-resident population was derived through in situ differentiation from activated circulatory cells, and was shaped by interaction with the gut microbiome and self-antigen in the brain. Single cell sequencing revealed that in the absence of murine CD4 T cells, resident microglia remained suspended between a fetal and adult state. This maturation defect resulted in excess immature neuronal synapses and behavioral abnormalities in the adult mouse. These results illuminate a role for CD4 T cells in the basic developmental processes of the brain, and a potential interconnected dynamic between the evolution of the immunological and neurological systems.",single cell RNA-seq of CD4+ cells from human brain and PBMC,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Liston A,The Babraham Institute,United Kingdom,GSM4367465;GSM4367466,"Jul 27, 2020","Mar 02, 2020","Jul 29, 2020"

Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells, obtained using a modified Antigen-Reactive T cell Enrichment (ARTE) assay, from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was ‘exhausted’ or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the dominant non-exhausted subset from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-κB signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness.

We used single cell RNA sequencing to probe ARDS at a higher resolution for  insights into ARDS pathogenesis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with pneumonia and sepsis with early ARDS were compared to that of sepsis patients who did not develop ARDS. Monocyte clusters from ARDS patients revealed multiple distinguishing characteristics in comparison to monocytes from patients without ARDS including down-regulation of SOCS3 expression accompanied by a pro-inflammatory signature with up-regulation of multiple type I IFN-induced genes, especially in CD16+ cells. These data show that monocytes of ARDS patients up-regulate expression of genes not just restricted to those associated with inflammation.

GSE149377,Large-scale production of human iPSC-derived macrophages for drug screening,32645954,"Tissue resident macrophages are key players in inflammatory processes and their activation and functionality is crucial in health and disease. Diseases associated with alterations in homeostasis or dysregulation of the innate immune system are numerous and include allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases as well as cancer. Hence, these cells are of high interest in drug development. Currently, the main sources of macrophages used in drug development are still primary cells isolated from blood or tissue, or immortalized cell lines (e.g. THP-1). Here, we describe an improved method for large-scale production of tissue resident macrophages from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in unprecedented yields. For this, iPSC-derived macrophages are thoroughly characterized to confirm their cell identity and thus their suitability for screening purposes. We demonstrate that this method to generate macrophages from iPSC overcomes the limitations of using primary cells, i.e. donor variability and limited availability of large cell numbers. Notably, the cells recapitulate key functional characteristics, including cytokine release, phagocytosis and migration. Genetic modifications can be introduced at the macrophage progenitor stage, so this methodology will facilitate the generation of reporters and gain- and loss-of-function mutants in an isogenetic background, essential assets for target validation.","Monocytes from primary cells or macrophage progenitors from iPSCs were differentiated into M0 macrophages (MCSF), M1 macrophages (GMCSF, INFG), and M2 macrophages (MCSF, IL4). iPSC-derived monocytes were also differentiated into microglia cells (CD34, GMCSF). 5 replicates were sequenced for each cell type and 5 additional samples were sequenced for primary and iPSC monocytes in a second run.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Gutbier S;Wanke F;Dahm N;Rümmelin A;Zimmermann S;Christensen K;Köchl F;Rautanen A;Hatje K;Geering B;Zhang JD;Britschgi M;Cowley SA;Patsch C,+41616875180,Switzerland,GSM4498750;GSM4498751;GSM4498752;GSM4498753;GSM4498754;GSM4498755;GSM4498756;GSM4498757;GSM4498758;GSM4498759;GSM4498760;GSM4498761;GSM4498762;GSM4498763;GSM4498764;GSM4498765;GSM4498766;GSM4498767;GSM4498768;GSM4498769;GSM4498770;GSM4498771;GSM4498772;GSM4498773;GSM4498774;GSM4498775;GSM4498776;GSM4498777;GSM4498778;GSM4498779;GSM4498780;GSM4498781;GSM4498782;GSM4498783;GSM4498784;GSM4498785;GSM4498786;GSM4498787;GSM4498788;GSM4498789;GSM4498790;GSM4498791;GSM4498792;GSM4498793;GSM4498794;GSM4498795;GSM4498796;GSM4498797;GSM4498798;GSM4498799,"Jul 07, 2020","Apr 26, 2020","Jul 13, 2020"

Here, we developed parallel single cell small RNA sequencing (PSCSR-seq), which enables highly sensitive and high-throughput miRNA expression profiling of individual cells. We applied PSCSR-seq to examine the small RNA profiles from large numbers of cultured cancer cells, human PBMCs, and from a tumor in a melanoma mouse model.

To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly upregulation of the TNF/IL-1beta-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1beta-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19 infection. Based on this, we propose that the type I IFN response exacerbates inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.","Single-cell RNA sequencing performed with PBMC of 5 flu, 11 COVID-19 patients and 4 healthy controls.The suffix of each barcode sequence represents patient information.'-1' - 'Sample1' - 'nCoV 1 scRNA-seq''-2' - 'Sample2' - 'nCoV 2 scRNA-seq''-3' - 'Sample3' - 'Flu 1 scRNA-seq''-4' - 'Sample4' - 'Flu 2 scRNA-seq''-5' - 'Sample5' - 'Normal 1 scRNA-seq''-6' - 'Sample6' - 'Flu 3 scRNA-seq''-7' - 'Sample7' - 'Flu 4 scRNA-seq''-8' - 'Sample8' - 'Flu 5 scRNA-seq''-9' - 'Sample9' - 'nCoV 3 scRNA-seq''-10' - 'Sample10' - 'nCoV 4 scRNA-seq''-11' - 'Sample11' - 'nCoV 5 scRNA-seq''-12' - 'Sample12' - 'nCoV 6 scRNA-seq''-13' - 'Sample13' - 'Normal 2 scRNA-seq''-14' - 'Sample14' - 'Normal 3 scRNA-seq''-15' - 'Sample15' - 'nCoV 7 scRNA-seq''-16' - 'Sample16' - 'nCoV 8 scRNA-seq''-17' - 'Sample17' - 'nCoV 9 scRNA-seq''-18' - 'Sample18' - 'nCoV 10 scRNA-seq''-19' - 'Sample19' - 'Normal 4 scRNA-seq''-20' - 'Sample20' - 'nCoV 11 scRNA-seq'",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens),Park S;Lee J;Jung I;Shin E,KAIST,South Korea,GSM4509011;GSM4509012;GSM4509013;GSM4509014;GSM4509015;GSM4509016;GSM4509017;GSM4509018;GSM4509019;GSM4509020;GSM4509021;GSM4509022;GSM4509023;GSM4509024;GSM4509025;GSM4509026;GSM4509027;GSM4509028;GSM4509029;GSM4509030,"Jul 06, 2020","May 01, 2020","Oct 19, 2022"

Here we present a multi-omics approach allowing the simultaneous targeted quantification of mRNA and protein expression in single-cells and investigate its performance to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations.Methods: We have quantified the single-cell expression of 397 genes at the mRNA level and up to 68 proteins using oligo-conjugated antibodies (AbSeq) in 43,656 primary CD4+ T cells isolated from blood and 31,907 CD45+ cells isolated from blood and matched duodenal biopsies. We explored the sensitivity of this targeted scRNA-seq approach to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations and identify trajectories of functional T-cell differentiation.Results: We provide a high-resolution map of human primary CD4+ T cells, and identify precise trajectories of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation in blood and tissue. The sensitivity provided by this multi-omics approach identified the expression of the B7 molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of CD4+ Tregs, and we further demonstrated that B7 expression has the potential to identify recently activated T cells in circulation. Moreover, we identified a rare subset of CCR9+ T cells in blood with gut-homing properties and expression of several immunomodulatory receptors, suggestive of a regulatory function at barrier sites.Conclusions: This transcriptomic and proteomic hybrid technology provides a cost-effective solution to dissect the heterogeneity of immune cell populations, including more precise and detailed descriptions of the differentiation and activation of circulating and tissue-resident cells in response to therapies and in stratification of patients.",Multi-omics characterisation of primary human CD4+ T cells (3 donors; resting and stimulated samples) and CD45+ cells (2 donors; paired blood and duodenal biopsies) by targeted scRNA-sequencing (BD Rhapsody and AbSeq),Other,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Trzupek D;Wicker LS;Todd JA;Ferreira RC,University of Oxford,United Kingdom,GSM4522889;GSM4522890;GSM4522891;GSM4522892;GSM4522893;GSM4522894,"Jun 12, 2020","May 07, 2020","Jun 29, 2020"

Until recently, direct, unbiased molecular analysis of allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells has not been possible. To better understand the diversity of these T cell subsets in allergy and asthma, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptome of ~50,000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells and Treg cells from asthmatics with HDM allergy and from three control groups: asthmatics without HDM allergy and non-asthmatics with and without HDM allergy. Our analyses show that HDM allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells are highly heterogeneous, and certain subsets are quantitatively and qualitatively different in subjects with HDM-reactive asthma.

GSE146046,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of allergen-specific T cells in allergy and asthma [RNA-Seq],32532832,"CD4+ helper T cells (TH) and regulatory T cells (Treg) that respond to common allergens play an important role in driving and dampening airway inflammation in patients with asthma. Until recently, direct, unbiased molecular analysis of allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells has not been possible. To better understand the diversity of these T cell subsets in allergy and asthma, we analyzed the single-cell transcriptome of ~50,000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells and Treg cells from asthmatics with HDM allergy and from three control groups: asthmatics without HDM allergy and non-asthmatics with and without HDM allergy. Our analyses show that HDM allergen-reactive TH and Treg cells are highly heterogeneous, and certain subsets are quantitatively and qualitatively different in subjects with HDM-reactive asthma.

Further, the EM cells present in responders were exhausted, suggesting prior recognition of tumor. Upon anti-PD-1 treatment, T cells of responders showed a shift towards increased differentiation and a higher relative abundance of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells than non-responders, with both populations and monocytes showing striking activation of interferon and MHC processing pathways. In addition to T cells, responders were enriched in classical monocytes prior to therapy, with a predominance of high TNF-α and growth factor activity associated with inhibition of NF-κB.

The specific T cells that mediate tumor rejection are unknown. T cells from human bladder tumors and non-malignant tissue were assessed with single-cell RNA and paired T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 30,604 T cells from 7 patients. We find that the states and repertoire of CD8+ T cells are not altered in tumors compared with non-malignant tissues. In contrast, single-cell analysis of CD4+ T cells demonstrates several tumor-specific states, including multiple distinct states of regulatory T cells. Surprisingly, we also find multiple cytotoxic CD4+ T cell states that are clonally expanded. These CD4+ T cells can kill autologous tumor in an MHC class II-dependent fashion and are suppressed by regulatory T cells. Further, a gene signature of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in tumors predicts a clinical response in 244 metastatic bladder cancer patients treated with anti-PD-L1.","Fresh bladder tumors and adjacent normal bladder tissue were obtained from surgical resection (cystectomy).

In contrast, and despite the conclusive demonstration that MLL-AF4 infant ALL arises in utero. In order to address this we purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) populations from four non-lineage switching presentation infant ALL cases and one ALL presentation which went on to lineage switch at relapse. The specific MLL-AF4 fusion event was determined in unsorted samples by LDI-PCR and identified in purified populations by nested PCR. In three cases where non-lineage restricted populations were able to be purified, MLL-AF4 was identified in the CD34+CD38-CD45RA+ population (LK228, LK230, LS01), the CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90- multipotential progenitor population (MPP, LS01) and even a candidate CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population (LK228) Interestingly, in a single non-switched MLL-AF9 case analysed for external comparison, the fusion was only identified in CD19+ blast/B cell populations, not in any HSPC population. Unexpectedly, we were also able to identify the presence of the MLL-AF4 fusion in apparently normally differentiated CD34-CD19/3-HLA-DR+CD14/11c+ monocytes/dendritic cells from the peripheral blood/bone marrow of 4/5 cases examined. This finding was further supported by single cell analysis of LS01PALL which identified the fusion in 2/22 CD34-CD19/3-HLA-DR+CD14/11c+ monocytes/dendritic cells analysed. Furthermore, the matched AML sample (LS01RAML) also contained MLL-AF4 positive mature T lymphoid cells. These data imply that MLL-AF4 does not impose a complete block on normal haematopoietic differentiation, and raise the question of what additional factors contribute to leukaemic lineage determination in the setting of the MLL-AF4 translocation. To examine the functional capacity of MLL-AF4 transformed precursor cells we generated a patient-derived xenograft model using NOD-scid/IL2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Serial xenotransplantation identified an MLL-AF4 positive clone persisting within the human CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ compartment across four generations of mice, confirming self-renewal of this population. Together these data identify an early multipotent progenitor or HSC as the putative cell of origin for MLL-AF4 ALL.

GSE137496,Defective SEC61α1 underlies a novel cause of autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia,32325141,"The molecular cause of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is unknown in 30-50% of patients. SEC61A1 encodes the α subunit of the heterotrimeric SEC61 complex, which governs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptide-dependent protein transport and passive calcium leakage. Recently, autosomal dominant mutations in SEC61A1 were reported to be pathogenic in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and glomerulocystic kidney disease. However the full spectrum of clinical manifestations in SEC61A1 mutations is yet to be explored. We investigated a SCN patient, the only child of healthy non-consanguineous Belgian parents. We identified a de novo private missense mutation in SEC61A1 (c.A275G;p.Q92R; CADD 24.5; msc 6.099) in the patient. The mutation results in diminished expression of the protein in PBMC and fibroblasts, and an increase in calcium leakage from the ER. In vitro differentiation of CD34+ cells recapitulated the patient’s clinical arrest in granulopoiesis. The impact of Q92R-SEC61α1 on neutrophil maturation was validated using HL-60 cells, where transduction reduced differentiation into CD11b+CD16+ cells. A potential mechanism for this defect is the uncontrolled initiation of the unfolded protein stress response (UPR), with single-cell analysis of primary bone-marrow revealing perturbed UPR in myeloid precursors, and in vitro differentiation of primary CD34+ cells into neutrophils revealing upregulation of the pro-apoptotic CHOP and BiP UPR-response genes. Together, these results support specific autosomal dominant mutations in SEC61A1 causing SCN through dysregulation of the UPR.","Two RBC depleted whole bone marrow aspirates; one patient with severe congenital neutropenia with a de novo mutation in SEC61A1, one healthy gender-matched control",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Liston A,The Babraham Institute,United Kingdom,GSM4080351;GSM4080352,"Apr 09, 2020","Sep 16, 2019","Jul 09, 2020"

Recently, the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression by sequencing was developed, which is commonly known as CITE-Seq. Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcript, but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets.Here, we describe a novel targeted transcriptomics approach that combines analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on more than 25,000 cells. This targeted approach requires only about 1/10 of the read depth compared to a whole transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts.

Currently however, there is no software to easily and simultaneously analyze both types of data. Here, we introduce Single-Cell Virtual Cytometer, an open-source software for flow cytometry-like visualization and exploration of multi-omics single cell datasets. Using an original CITE-seq dataset of PBMC from an healthy donor, we illustrate its use for the integrated analysis of transcriptomes and epitopes of functional maturation in peripheral T lymphocytes from healthy donors. So this free and open-source algorithm constitutes a unique resource for biologists seeking for a user-friendly analytic tool for multimodal single cell datasets.","peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by sedimentation on Lymphopure TM (BioLegend) and labelled with 5 TotalSeq TM -A antibody mixes (to CD14, CD16, CD19, CD3, CD4, CD45, CD45RA, CD62L, CD8 and isotype controls) .

GSE143197,Inference and effects of barcode multiplets in droplet-based single-cell assays,32054859,"A widespread assumption for single-cell analyses specifies that one cell’s nucleic acids are predominantly captured by one oligonucleotide barcode. However, we show that ~13-21% of cell barcodes from the 10x Chromium scATAC-seq assay may have been derived from a droplet with more than one oligonucleotide sequence, which we call “barcode multiplets”. We demonstrate that barcode multiplets can be derived from at least two different sources. First, we confirm that  approximately 4% of droplets from the 10x platform may contain multiple beads. Additionally, we find that approximately 5% of beads may contain detectable levels of multiple oligonucleotide barcodes. We show that this artifact can confound single-cell analyses, including the interpretation of clonal diversity and proliferation of intra-tumor lymphocytes. Overall, our work provides a conceptual and computational framework to identify and assess the impacts of barcode multiplets in single-cell data.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from a healthy individual and processed with 10x scATAC-seq to determine the rate of barcode multiplets,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Lareau C;Ma S;Duarte F;Buenrostro J,Memorial Sloan Kettering,USA,GSM4251978,"Jan 07, 2020","Jan 06, 2020","Mar 02, 2020"

Here, using single cell transcriptomics, we identified a specific border-associated composition and transcriptome of CSF leukocytes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) – an autoimmune disease of the CNS – increased transcriptional diversity in blood, but increased cell type diversity in CSF including a higher abundance of cytotoxic phenotype T helper cells. A new analytical approach, named cell set enrichment analysis (CSEA) identified a cluster-independent increase of follicular T helper (TFH) cells potentially driving the known expansion of B lineage cells in the CSF in MS. In mice, TFH cells accordingly promoted B cell infiltration into the CNS and the severity of MS animal models.

We performed a multi-center study comparing 13 commonly used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols using a highly heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative and integrative analysis at cell type and state level revealed marked differences in protocol performance, highlighting a series of key features for cell atlas projects. These should be considered when defining guidelines and standards for international consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas project.","The samples consists of two complex tissues (human PBMC and mouse colon) and three cell lines (HEK293-RFP, NIH3T3-GFP, MDCK-Turbo650).

We sorted individual DEs, Bcon and Tcon cells from PBMCs of one type I diabetes patient and analyzed the transcriptomes  of 34 DEs,  20 Bcon , and 23 Tcon  using the plate-based SMART-seq2 protocol (Tirosh and Suva, 2018; Tirosh et al., 2016).  Our results show that DEs have uniquely expressed genes along with genes encoding lineage markers of T and B cells.","Examination of the transcriptomes of three cell types, Des (Dual Expressors), Bcon (Conventional B) and Tcon (Conventional T) cells from the  PBMCs of one type I diabetes patient",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Abdel H;Chunfa J,3124043831,USA,GSM3698000;GSM3698002;GSM3698004;GSM3698006;GSM3698007;GSM3698009;GSM3698011;GSM3698012;GSM3698014;GSM3698016;GSM3698018;GSM3698019;GSM3698021;GSM3698023;GSM3698024;GSM3698026;GSM3698028;GSM3698030;GSM3698031;GSM3698033;GSM3698035;GSM3698037;GSM3698038;GSM3698040;GSM3698042;GSM3698043;GSM3698045;GSM3698047;GSM3698049;GSM3698051;GSM3698052;GSM3698054;GSM3698056;GSM3698057;GSM3698059;GSM3698061;GSM3698063;GSM3698064;GSM3698066;GSM3698068;GSM3698070;GSM3698072;GSM3698074;GSM3698076;GSM3698077;GSM3698079;GSM3698081;GSM3698083;GSM3698085;GSM3698086;GSM3698088;GSM3698090;GSM3698092;GSM3698093;GSM3698095;GSM3698097;GSM3698099;GSM3698101;GSM3698102;GSM3698104;GSM3698106;GSM3698108;GSM3698110;GSM3698112;GSM3698114;GSM3698117;GSM3698119;GSM3698121;GSM3698123;GSM3698125;GSM3698127;GSM3698129;GSM3698131;GSM3698133;GSM3698135;GSM3698136;GSM3698139,"Jun 02, 2019","Apr 01, 2019","Jun 03, 2019"
GSE132044,Systematic comparative analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing methods,32341560,"A multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell and/or single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development.","We systematically and directly compared seven single cell RNA-sequencing methods, including two low-throughput plate-based methods (Smart-seq2 and CEL-Seq2) and five high-throughput methods (10x Chromium (v2, v3), Drop-seq, Seq-Well, inDrops, and sci-RNA-seq), producing expression profiles from ~92,000 cells (nuclei) overall. We tested three sample types – a mixture of human and mouse cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and mouse cortex, each sample with two replicates – to generate a total of 36 different single cell RNA-sequencing libraries. For mouse cortex, we tested four single nucleus RNA-sequencing methods (Smart-seq2, 10x Chromium (v2), DroNc-seq, and sci-RNA-seq). We tested each sample type in two experiments (Mixture1 and Mixture2, PBMC1 and PBMC2, Cortex1 and Cortex2) run on different days to assess reproducibility. In each comparison experiment, we started with one sample with processing of aliquots starting at the same time for each method. The only exceptions were for Seq-Well in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical PBMC aliquot a second time to obtain a Seq-Well dataset with sufficient cells profiled for PBMCs, and for 10x Chromium in PBMC1, in which we thawed an identical aliquot to directly compare version 2 (v2) with version 3 (v3). In each experiment, we aimed to collect data from ~350 cells for the low-throughput methods and ~3,000 cells for the high-throughput methods. In each experiment, we also used an aliquot of cells to generate a bulk RNA-sequencing library as a control. We sequenced all libraries together in an attempt to avoid batch effects due to varying sequence quality among Illumina flowcell lanes, with the following exceptions. We sequenced the inDrops libraries separately because they have an opposite read structure from those generated with the other methods. We performed additional sequencing for some libraries in an attempt to sequence similar numbers of reads per cell for each low or high throughput method. We aimed for 50,000 to 100,000 reads per cell for high-throughput methods and 750,000 to 1,000,000 reads per cell for low-throughput methods. The scRNA-seq FASTQ files are named with sample names, Illumina flowcell lanes, and library preparing methods. Different fields are separated by dots (.), for example, PBMC2.CC86JANXX.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.1.fastq.gz, where PBMC2 is the sample name (can be Mixture1, Mixture2, PBMC1, PBMC2, Cortex1, and Cortex2), CC86JANXX is the flowcell lanes, 011818 is the library preparation date, and DropSeq is the RNA-seq method (Drop-seq in this case, can be SM2, CELseq, 10X, DropSeq, DroNcSeq, SeqWell, inDrops, and SciSeq). This FASTQ file (read 1) includes cell barcodes and UMI information. The corresponding cDNA reads are in PBMC2.CC86JANXX.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.2.fastq.gz (read2). For more information about the structures of reads from different protocols, please see Supplementary Table 11 of the manuscript. FASTQ files with the same sample name and library preparation method but different flowcell lanes are from the same library but sequenced at different times, e.g., PBMC2.CCLBDANXX.68.011818-DropSeq.unmapped.1.fastq.gz. Therefore, these FASTQ files can be merged together for analyses. For 10x Chromium data, the reads from the same library are split into four files (10X_A, 10X_B, 10X_C, and 10X_D) and the reads from these files can also be merged together.",Expression profiling by

GSE127471,High-throughput tissue dissection and cell purification with digital cytometry [scRNA-Seq],31061481,"Tissue composition is a major determinant of phenotypic variation and a key factor influencing disease outcomes. Although scRNA-Seq has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, it is currently impractical for large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. To overcome these challenges, we extended Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) into a new platform for in silico cytometry. Our approach enables the simultaneous inference of cell type abundance and cell type-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) from bulk tissue transcriptomes. The utility of this integrated framework, called CIBERSORTx, is demonstrated in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single cell reference profiles are used to dissect primary clinical specimens, revealing cell type-specific signatures of driver mutations and immunotherapy response. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation, or viable cells.","Single cell libraries were prepared from cryopreserved NSCLC PBMC single cell suspensions using Chromium with v2 chemistry (10x Genomics), and were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).Raw data are not available for this Series due to patient privacy concerns.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Newman AM;Steen CB;Liu C;Gentles AJ;Chaudhuri AA;Scherer F;Khodadoust MS;Shahrokh Esfahani M;Luca BA;Steiner D;Diehn M;Alizadeh AA,Stanford University,USA,GSM3635372,"May 06, 2019","Feb 28, 2019","Jul 10, 2019"

Although they have important anticancer functions, most current scRNA-Seq studies do not identify γδ T lymphocytes since their transcriptomes at the single cell level are unknown. Here we show that high resolution clustering of large scRNA-Seq data sets and a combination of gene signatures allow the specific detection of human γδ T lymphocytes and identification of their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets in large data sets from complex cell mixtures. In t-SNE plots from blood and tumor samples, the few γδ T lymphocytes appear collectively embedded between cytotoxic CD8 T and NK cells. Their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets form close yet distinct sub-clusters respectively neighbouring NK and CD8 T cells owing to expression of shared and distinct cytotoxic maturation genes. Similar pseudo-time maturation trajectories of TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 γδ T lymphocytes were discovered, unveiling in both subsets an unattended pool of TEMRA cells with preserved proliferative capacity, a finding confirmed by in vitro proliferation assays. Overall, the single cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual gd T lymphocytes from different CMV+ and CMV- donors reflect cytotoxic maturation stages driven by the immunological history of donors.

In blood, scATAC-seq allows marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity, and reconstruction of trajectories of differentiation from progenitors to diverse and rare immune cell types. In basal cell carcinoma, scATAC-seq reveals regulatory landscapes of malignant, stromal, and immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, scATAC-seq of serial tumor biopsies before and after PD-1 blockade allows identification of chromatin regulators and differentiation trajectories of therapy-responsive intratumoral T cell subsets, revealing a shared regulatory program driving CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development in association with clinical response.

GSE122703,Single-cell profiling of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma reveals underlying heterogeneity predicting with disease progression.,"30718356, 35390145","Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL), encompassing a spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the skin, have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40 years. Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive form of CTCL characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for SS reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due in part to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. Using single-cell sequencing of RNA, we confirm that SS is a clonal disease, but we further define a more complex model featuring distinct transcriptomic states within SS. Our analysis showed the involvement of FOXP3+ malignant T cells during clonal evolution, transitioning from FOXP3+ T cells to GATA3+ or IKZF2+ (HELIOS) tumor cells. Transcriptomic diversities in a clonal tumor can be used to predict disease stage, and we were able to characterize a gene signature that predicts disease stage with close to 80% accuracy. Supporting the critical role of FOXP3+ T cell involvement during clonal evolution, FOXP3 was found to be the most important factor to predict early disease in SS, along with another 19 genes used to predict CTCL stage. This work offers insight into the heterogeneity of SS, providing better understanding of the transcriptomic diversities within a clonal tumor, which can predict tumor stage and thereby offer guidance of therapy.","Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CD4+ T cells isolated from the blood of a patient with Sezary Syndrome using the 10x genomics 5-prime expression profiling kits.

GSE128066,A Bayesian mixture model for clustering droplet-based single cell transcriptomic data from population studies,30967541,"Abstract: The recently developed droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it feasible to perform a population-scale scRNA-seq study, in which the transcriptome is measured for tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals. Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we develop a BAyesian Mixture Model for Single Cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood and lung cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals.Data purpose: To evaluate the performance of BAMM-SC for clustering droplet-based scRNA-seq data in population-based study, we performed single cell RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from whole blood obtained from 4 healthy donors, and on lung cells isolated from streptococcus pneumonia (SP) infected and naïve mice.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors, skin cells from the dorsal mid-forearm of healthy donors, and lung cells from streptococcus pneumonia (SP) infected and naïve mice",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Chen K;Chen W;Sun Z,University of Pittsburgh,USA,GSM3662224;GSM3662225;GSM3662226;GSM3662227;GSM3665016;GSM3665017;GSM3665018;GSM3665019;GSM3667327;GSM3667328;GSM3667329,"Mar 09, 2019","Mar 08, 2019","Apr 17, 2019"

Although ibrutinib is not curative, it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples collected before and during ibrutinib therapy, we identified characteristic ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design of ibrutinib combination therapies.

Notably, we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major intratumoral proliferating immune cell compartment and that the intensity of the dysfunctional signature is associated with tumor-reactivity.

GSE111360,Organoid modeling of the tumor immune microenvironment,30550791,"The interaction of neoplastic cells with their tumor microenvironment (TME) is required for cancer progression. However, in vitro cancer models, including recent in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures of primary human tumors, are typically comprised exclusively of neoplastic epithelium, with stromal and/or immune interactions requiring artificial reconstitution. As relevant to cancer immunotherapy, the unified co-culture of primary tumor epithelia with their endogenous, syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a cohesive unit has remained particularly elusive. Here, we used a single 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) methodology to successfully propagate 3D Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids (PDOs) as primary tumor epithelia together with native immune and myofibroblast stromal compartments without reconstitution. Derived from >100 diverse human surgically resected tumor samples or from murine tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, PDOs preserved cancer histologic subtypes and mutational spectrum with endogenous T, B, NK cells and macrophages integrally embedded amidst the tumor epithelium. PDO-based TILs accurately recapitulated the T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum of the original tumors, as determined by a robust droplet-based immune profiling solution that links gene expression and immune repertoire in single cells. Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment of organoids from murine tumors from syngeneic immunocompetent hosts induced activation and cytolytic activity of tumor antigen-specific TILs, indicating successful PDO modeling of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-tumor immunity. Crucially, the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab activated TILs in PDOs from human lung, renal and melanoma clinical tumor resections. The organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with its endogenous immune stroma should facilitate mechanistic investigation of TME-specific local tumor immunity, with applications for functional testing of individualized patient immunotherapy responses.",Single cell GEX and VDJ profiling from the same samples,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing<br/>Other,Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens),Zheng G;Zhu J,6504985171,USA,GSM3029087;GSM3029088;GSM3029089;GSM3029090;GSM3029091;GSM3029092;GSM3029093;GSM3029094;GSM3029103;GSM3029104;GSM3029105;GSM3029106;GSM3029107;GSM3029108;GSM3029109;GSM3029110;GSM3029111;GSM3029112;GSM3029113;GSM3029114;GSM3029115;GSM3029116;GSM3029117;GSM3029118;GSM3029119;GSM3029120;GSM3029121;GSM3457010;GSM3457011;GSM3457012;GSM3457013;GSM3457014;GSM3457015;GSM3457016;GSM3457017,"Dec 13, 2018","Mar 02, 2018","Mar 21, 2019"
GSE117156,Single cell dissection of plasma cell heterogeneity in symptomatic and asymptomatic myeloma,30523328,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell (PC) malignancy, is the second most common blood cancer. Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity within and between patients is poorly characterized, hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here, we apply single cell RNA-seq to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the MM progression spectrum. We define malignant PC at single cell resolution, demonstrating high inter-patient variability that can be explained by expression of known MM drivers and additional putative factors. Within newly diagnosed patients, we identify extensive sub-clonal structures for 10/29 patients. In asymptomatic patients with early disease and in minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect tumor PC for a subset of the patients, with the same drivers of active myeloma. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells (CTC) allows detection of malignant PC, which reflect the BM disease. Our work establishes scRNA-seq for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.","The study includes 29 newly diagnosed patients with plasma cell neoplasms and 11 control donors, for which bone marrow plasma cells were single cell sorted by FACS, and their mRNA sequenced.

Recently, a highly invasive multi-drug resistant S.

Here we utilised fluorescently labelled invasive and non-invasive strains of Salmonella combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to study the transcriptomes of individual infected and bystander DCs. The transcriptomes displayed a repertoire of cell instrinsic and extrinsic innate response states that differed between invasive and non-invasive strains. Gene expression heterogeneity was increased in DCs challenged with invasive Salmonella. DCs exposed but not harbouring invasive Salmonella exhibited a hyper-activated profile that likely facilitates trafficking of infected cells and dissemination of internalised intact bacteria. In contrast, invasive Salmonella containing DCs demonstrate reprogramming of trafficking genes required to avoid autophagic destruction.

GSE103568,Sensitive and powerful single-cell RNA sequencing using mcSCRB-seq,30050112,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a central genome-wide method to characterize cellular identities and processes. Consequently, improving its sensitivity, flexibility, and cost-efficiency can advance many research questions. Among the flexible plate-based methods, single-cell RNA barcoding and sequencing (SCRB-seq) is highly sensitive and efficient. Here, we systematically evaluate experimental conditions of this protocol and find that adding polyethylene glycol considerably increases sensitivity by enhancing cDNA synthesis. Furthermore, using Terra polymerase increases efficiency due to a more even cDNA amplification that requires less sequencing of libraries. We combined these and other improvements to develop a scRNA-seq library protocol we call molecular crowding SCRB-seq (mcSCRB-seq), which we show to be one of the most sensitive, efficient, and

GSE112845,PBMC Fixation and Processing for Chromium Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,30016977,"Background:  Interest in single-cell whole transcriptome analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works, investigators have used live cells which represent several inconveniences and limitations. Some recent cell fixation methods did not work with most primary cells including immune cells.Methods:    The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve PBMCs for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10X Chromium platform.Results:     When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to three-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3X saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3X SSC were successfully implemented into 10X Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol was validated in CD8+ T cell and several other cell types.Conclusions:  We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will substantially enable complex experimental design with primary cells at single cell resolution.","single cell RNA sequencing of PBMC, CD8+ T cell or KLM1 cell line after fixation with methonal and resuspension in SSC buffer",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Chen J;Cheung F;Tsang J,2406273273,USA,GSM3087619;GSM3087622;GSM3087624;GSM3087626;GSM3087628;GSM3087629;GSM3087631;GSM3087633;GSM3087634,"Jul 25, 2018","Apr 09, 2018","Mar 26, 2019"

Typhi) or Salmonella Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi). we used mass cytometry, to identify effector CD4+ T cells circulating during infection. We identified a population of CCR7-CD38+ cells accumulating during infection, and via unbiased single cell cloning and expansion we demonstrated that these CCR7-CD38+ cells are enriched in Salmonella specific T cells. In this experiment we performed TCR repertoire analysis of CCR7-CD38+ and CCR7-CD38- cells to determine the clonality of CCR7-CD38+ cells, the overlap between the repertoire of CCR7-CD38+ cells and of non-activated effector CCR7-CD38- cells, and to identify within CCR7-CD38+ and CCR7-CD38- cells the presence of the CDR3b TCR sequence of the pathogen specific T cell clones isolated from  CCR7-CD38+ cells",Analysis of the TCR repertoire of CCR7-CD38+ and CCR7-CD38+ CD4 T cells isolated from frozen PBMC after diagnosis of enteric fever in one volunteer challenged with Salmonella Typhi and one challenged with Salmonella Paratyphi A,Other,Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens),Rei M;Miguel Susano Pinto D;Napolitani G,University of Oxford,United Kingdom,GSM3097067;GSM3097068;GSM3097069;GSM3097070;GSM3097071;GSM3097072;GSM3097073;GSM3097074,"May 13, 2018","Apr 13, 2018","Jan 25, 2019"

However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple datasets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq datasets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across datasets and downstream comparative analysis. Implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), we use our approach to align scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell ‘atlases’ generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.",Human PBMCs were profiled using ddSeq and bulk RNA-seq.

GSE111727,Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Transcriptional Heterogeneity in Latent and Reactivated HIV-infected Cells,29694901,"Despite effective treatment, HIV can persist in latent reservoirs, which represent a major obstacle towards HIV eradication. Targeting and reactivating latent cells is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of HIV infected cells. Here, we used a primary model of HIV latency and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity during HIV latency and reactivation. Our analysis identified transcriptional programs leading to successful reactivation of HIV expression. We further validated our results using primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals.","Human primary CD4+ T-cells were infected, cultured, and maintained in a resting, latent phenotype in order to generate a primary model of HIV latency. Latently infected cells were either left untreated, or exposed to SAHA or TCR stimulation, followed by single-cell isolation and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis. Bulk RNA-Seq experiments were also performed as control. To validate the observed cellular heterogeneity in the primary model of HIV latency, we used primary CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV+ individuals. As for the primary HIV latency model, resting cells from HIV+ individuals were either not treated or TCR-treated before single cell isolation and single-cell RNA-Seq.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens),Golumbeanu M;Cristinelli S;Rato S;Munoz M;Cavassini M;Beerenwinkel N;Ciuffi A,ETH Zürich,Switzerland,GSM3038071;GSM3038072;GSM3038073;GSM3038074;GSM3038075;GSM3038076;GSM3038077;GSM3038078;GSM3038079;GSM3038080;GSM3038081;GSM3038082;GSM3038083;GSM3038084;GSM3038085;GSM3038086;GSM3038087;GSM3038088;GSM3038089;GSM3038090;GSM3038091;GSM3038092;GSM3038093;GSM3038094;GSM3038095;GSM3038096;GSM3038097;GSM3038098;GSM3038099;GSM3038100;GSM3038101;GSM3038102;GSM3038103;GSM3038104;GSM3038105;GSM3038106;GSM3038107;GSM3038108;GSM3038109;GSM3038110;GSM3038111;GSM3038112;GSM3038113;GSM3038114;GSM3038115;GSM3038116;GSM3038117;GSM3038118;GSM3038119;GSM3038120;GSM3038121;GSM3038122;GSM3038123;GSM3038124;GSM3038125;GSM3038126;GSM3038127;GSM3038128;GSM3038129;GSM3038130;GSM3038131;GSM3038132;GSM3038133;GSM3038134;GSM3038135;GSM3038136;GSM3038137;GSM3038138;GSM3038139;GSM3038140;GSM3038141;GSM3038142;GSM3038143;GSM3038144;GSM3038145;GSM3038146;GSM3038147;GSM3038148;GSM3038149;GSM3038150;GSM3038151;GSM3038152;GSM3038153;GSM3038154;GSM3038155;GSM3038156;GSM3038157;GSM3038158;GSM3038159;GSM3038160;GSM3038161;GSM3038162;GSM3038163;GSM3038164;GSM3038165;GSM3038166;GSM3038167;GSM3038168;GSM3038169;GSM3038170;GSM3038171;GSM3038172;GSM3038173;GSM3038174;GSM3038175;GSM3038176;GSM3038177;GSM3038178;GSM3038179;GSM3038180;GSM3038181;GSM3038182;GSM3038183;GSM3038184;GSM3038185;GSM3038186;GSM3038187;GSM3038188;GSM3038189;GSM3038190;GSM3038191;GSM3038192;GSM3038193;GSM3038194;GSM3038195;GSM3038196;GSM3038197;GSM3038198;GSM3038199;GSM3038200;GSM3038201;GSM3038202;GSM3038203;GSM3038204;GSM3038205;GSM3038206;GSM3038207;GSM3038208;GSM3038209;GSM3038210;GSM3038211;GSM3038212;GSM3038213;GSM3038214;GSM3038215;GSM3038216;GSM3038217;GSM3038218;GSM3038219;GSM3038220;GSM3038221;GSM3038222;GSM3038223;GSM3038224;GSM3038225;GSM3038226;GSM3038227;GSM3038228;GSM3038229;GSM3038230;GSM3038231;GSM3038232;GSM3038233;GSM3038234;GSM3038235;GSM3038236;GSM3038237;GSM3038238;GSM3038239;GSM3038240;GSM3038241;GSM3038242;GSM3038243;GSM3038244;GSM3038245;GSM3038246;GSM3038247;GSM3038248;GSM3038249;GSM3038250;GSM3038251;GSM3038252;GSM3038253;GSM3038254;GSM3038255;GSM3038256;GSM3038257;GSM3038258;GSM3038259;GSM3038260;GSM3038261;GSM3038262;GSM3038263;GSM3038264;GSM3038265;GSM3038266;GSM3038267;GSM3038268;GSM3038269;GSM3038270;GSM3038271;GSM3038272;GSM3038273;GSM3038274;GSM3038275;GSM3038276;GSM3038277;GSM3038278;GSM3038279;GSM3038280;GSM3038281;GSM3038282;GSM3038283;GSM3038284;GSM3038285;GSM3038286;GSM3038287;GSM3038288;GSM3038289;GSM3038290;GSM3038291;GSM3038292;GSM3038293;GSM3038294;GSM3038295;GSM3038296;GSM3038297;GSM3038298;GSM3038299;GSM3038300;GSM3038301;GSM3038302;GSM3038303;GSM3038304;GSM3038305;GSM3038306;GSM3038307;GSM3038308;GSM3038309;GSM3038310;GSM3038311;GSM3038312;GSM3038313;GSM3038314;GSM3038315;GSM3038316;GSM3038317;GSM3038318;GSM3038319;GSM3038320;GSM3038321;GSM3038322;GSM3038323;GSM3038324;GSM3038325;GSM3038326;GSM3038327;GSM3038328;GSM3038329;GSM3038330;GSM3038331;GSM3038332;GSM3038333;GSM3038334;GSM3038335;GSM3038336;GSM3038337;GSM3038338;GSM3038339;GSM3038340;GSM3038341;GSM3038342;GSM3038343;GSM3038344;GSM3038345;GSM3038346;GSM3038347;GSM3038348;GSM3038349;GSM3038350;GSM3038351;GSM3038352;GSM3038353;GSM3038354;GSM3038355;GSM3038356;GSM3038357;GSM3038358;GSM3038359;GSM3038360;GSM3038361;GSM3038362;GSM3038363;GSM3038364;GSM3038365;GSM3038366;GSM3038367;GSM3038368;GSM3038369;GSM3038370;GSM3038371;GSM3038372;GSM3038373;GSM3038374;GSM3038375;GSM3038376;GSM3038377;GSM3038378;GSM3038379;GSM3038380;GSM3038381;GSM3038382;GSM3038383;GSM3038384;GSM3038385;GSM3038386;GSM3038387;GSM3038388;GSM3038389;GSM3038390;GSM3038391;GSM3038392;GSM3038393;GSM3038394;GSM3038395;GSM3038396;GSM3038397;GSM3038398;GSM3038399;GSM3038400;GSM3038401;GSM3038402;GSM3038403;GSM3038404;GSM3038405;GSM3038406;GSM3038407;GSM3038408;GSM3038409;GSM3038410;GSM3038411;GSM3038412;GSM3038413;GSM3038414;GSM3038415;GSM3038416;GSM3038417;GSM3038418;GSM3038419;GSM3038420;GSM3038421;GSM3038422;GSM3038423;GSM3038424;GSM3038425;GSM3038426;GSM3038427;GSM3038428;GSM3038429;GSM3038430;GSM3038431;GSM3038432;GSM3038433;GSM3038434;GSM3038435;GSM3038436;GSM3038437;GSM3038438;GSM3038439;GSM3038440;GSM3038441;GSM3038442;GSM3038443;GSM3038444;GSM3038445;GSM3038446;GSM3038447;GSM3038448;GSM3038449;GSM3038450;GSM3038451;GSM3038452;GSM3038453;GSM3038454;GSM3038455;GSM3038456;GSM3038457,"Mar 13, 2018","Mar 12, 2018","Mar 27, 2019"
GSE106543,Precursors of human CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes identified by single-cell transcriptome analysis [10X genomics],29352091,"CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, heterogeneity and clonal diversity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. The single-cell differential gene expression analysis, revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and co-stimulatory function, and transcripts of unknown cytotoxicity-related function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared to cells in the central and effector memory subsets (TCM, TEM). Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly, we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and thus could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be utilized to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.",Single cell RNA-seq analysis of  purified populations of human CD4 memory cell subsets by both bulk TCR-sequencing.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens),Patil VS;Madrigal A;Schmiedel BJ;Clarke J;O'Rourke P;Harris E;de Silva AD;Harris E;Peters B;Seumois G;Weiskopf D;Sette A;Vijayanand P,La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology,USA,GSM2842538;GSM2842539,"Feb 03, 2018","Nov 05, 2017","May 15, 2019"

GSE106542,Precursors of human CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes identified by single-cell transcriptome analysis [bulk RNA-seq],29352091,"CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) have been reported to play a protective role in several viral infections. However, little is known in humans about the biology of CD4-CTL generation, their functional properties, heterogeneity and clonal diversity, especially in relation to other well-described CD4+ memory T cell subsets. We performed single-cell RNA-seq in over 9000 cells to unravel CD4-CTL heterogeneity, transcriptional profile and clonality in humans. The single-cell differential gene expression analysis, revealed a spectrum of known transcripts, including several linked to cytotoxic and co-stimulatory function, and transcripts of unknown cytotoxicity-related function that are expressed at higher levels in the TEMRA subset, which is highly enriched for CD4-CTLs, compared to cells in the central and effector memory subsets (TCM, TEM). Simultaneous T cells antigen receptor (TCR) analysis in single-cells and bulk subsets revealed that CD4-TEMRA cells show marked clonal expansion compared to TCM and TEM cells and that the majority of CD4-TEMRA were dengue virus (DENV)-specific in subjects with previous DENV infection. The profile of CD4-TEMRA was highly heterogeneous across subjects, with four distinct clusters identified by the single-cell analysis. Most importantly, we identified distinct clusters of CD4-CTL effector and precursor cells in the TEMRA subset; the precursor cells shared TCR clonotypes with CD4-CTL effectors and were distinguished by high expression of the interleukin-7 receptor. Our identification of a CD4-CTL precursor population may allow further investigation of how CD4-CTLs arise in humans and thus could provide insights into the mechanisms that may be utilized to generate durable and effective CD4-CTL immunity.",Transcriptome  analysis of  purified populations of human CD4 memory cell subsets by bulk RNA-sequencing.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens),Patil VS;Madrigal A;Schmiedel BJ;Clarke J;O'Rourke P;Harris E;de Silva AD;Harris E;Peters B;Seumois G;Weiskopf D;Sette A;Vijayanand P,La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology,USA,GSM2842498;GSM2842499;GSM2842500;GSM2842501;GSM2842502;GSM2842503;GSM2842504;GSM2842505;GSM2842506;GSM2842507;GSM2842508;GSM2842509;GSM2842510;GSM2842511;GSM2842512;GSM2842513;GSM2842514;GSM2842515;GSM2842516;GSM2842517;GSM2842518;GSM2842519;GSM2842520;GSM2842521;GSM2842522;GSM2842523;GSM2842524;GSM2842525;GSM2842526;GSM2842527;GSM2842528;GSM2842529;GSM2842530;GSM2842531;GSM2842532;GSM2842533;GSM2842534;GSM2842535;GSM2842536;GSM2842537,"Jan 24, 2018","Nov 05, 2017","May 15, 2019"

GSE107816,Transcript-indexed ATAC-seq reveals paired single-cell T cell receptor identity and chromatin accessibility for precision immune profiling [single cell],,"T cells create vast amounts of diversity in their T cell receptor (TCR) genes, enabling individual clones to recognize particular peptide-MHC ligands. Here we combine transposase accessible chromatin analysis and TCR sequencing (T-ATAC-seq) at the single-cell level. Using this approach, we identify epigenomic signatures in immortalized leukemic T cells, primary human T cells from healthy volunteers, and primary leukemic T cells from clinical patient samples. In healthy peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, we identify cis and trans regulators of naive and memory T cell states and find significant heterogeneity in surface marker-defined populations. In patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, we identify leukemic and non-leukemic regulatory pathways in cells from the same individual, which has been previously challenging. Thus, T-ATAC-seq is a new tool enabling analysis of epigenomic landscapes in clonal T cells and should be valuable for studies of T cell malignancy, immunity, and immunotherapy.","CD4+ Jurkat cells, primary CD4+ T cell subsets sorted from peripheral blood of healthy human volunteers, or primary CD4+ T cells sorted from peripheral blood of patients with Sezary syndrome. Single cells from each cell population were subjected to open chromatin single-cell ATAC-seq profiling. Single-cell samples include Jurkat cells, CD4+ Naive T cells, CD4+CD45RA- Memory T cells, CD4+ TH17 cells, and CD26+ and CD26- CD4+ cells from Sezary patients. Single cell experiments were performed in cell samples from 2-3 biological replicates (each replicate is indicated by it's J or C plate number).",Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput

GSE96583,Multiplexing droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing using genetic barcodes,29227470,"Here, we introduce an in-silico algorithm demuxlet that harnesses naturally occurring genetic variation in a pool of cells from unrelated individuals to discover the sample identity of each cell and identify droplets containing cells from two different individuals (doublets). These two capabilities enable a simple multiplexing design that increases single cell library construction throughput by experimental design where cells from genetically diverse samples are multiplexed and captured at 2-10x over standard workflows. We further demonstrate the utility of sample multiplexing by characterizing the interindividual variability in cell type-specific responses of ~15k PBMCs to interferon-beta, a potent cytokine. Our computational tool enables sample multiplexing of droplet-based single cell RNA-seq for large-scale studies of population variation and could be extended to other single cell datasets that incorporate natural or synthetic DNA barcodes.","HiSeq 2500 data for sequencing of PBMCs from SLE patients and 2 controls.

GSE80171,Transcriptome profiles of human pre-DC and DC subsets in peripheral blood,"28473638, 30405621","Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. Important questions on the origins and differentiation paths of human DC populations remain elusive. Here we combined two high-dimensional technologies, single-cell mRNA sequencing and mass cytometry to define and characterize CD33+CD45RA+ DC precursors (pre-DC) present in human blood. In this study, we showed that a previously understimated pre-DC population shares surface markers with plasmacytoid DC (pDC), but has distinct functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Finally, we trace the origin of DCs from BM to peripheral blood and reveal that pre-DC comprise three sub-populations - 1 uncommitted sub-population and 2 lineage-committed sub-populations. The discovery of committed pre-DC populations in present in human peripheral blood confirms the existence of DC as a distinct hematopoietic lineage and opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting.",Gene expression analysis using total RNA from specific human pre-DC and dendritic cell subsets purified by FACS.,Expression profiling by array,Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip,See P;Dutetre C;Duan K;Poidinger M;Ginhoux F,Singapore Immunology Network,Singapore,GSM2114023;GSM2114024;GSM2114025;GSM2114026;GSM2114027;GSM2114028;GSM2114029;GSM2114030;GSM2114031;GSM2114032;GSM2114033;GSM2114034;GSM2114035;GSM2114036;GSM2114037;GSM2114038;GSM2114039;GSM2114040,"May 21, 2017","Apr 12, 2016","Nov 14, 2018"

Here, we present Seq-Well, a portable, low-cost platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA -seq. Barcoded mRNA capture beads and single cells are sealed in an array of subnanoliter wells using a semipermeable membrane, enabling efficient cell lysis and transcript capture. We characterize Seq-Well extensively and use it to profile thousands of primary human macrophages exposed to tuberculosis.","Single-cell RNA sequencing experiments of HEK/3T3 mixing, PBMCs, and TB-exposed Macrophages.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens),Shalek AK;Hughes TK,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,GSM2486329;GSM2486330;GSM2486331;GSM2486332;GSM2486333;GSM2486334;GSM2486335,"Feb 17, 2017","Dec 16, 2016","May 15, 2019"

GSE56327,A PBMC Transcriptional Module Related to Vascular Function,24759906,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including rare circulating stem and progenitor cells (CSPCs), have important yet poorly understood roles in the maintenance and repair of blood vessels and perfused organs. Our hypothesis was that the identities and functions of CSPCs in cardiovascular health could be ascertained by analyzing the patterns of their co-expressed markers in unselected PBMC samples. Because gene microarrays had failed to detect many stem cell-associated genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the expression of 45 primitive and tissue differentiation markers in PBMCs from healthy and hypertensive human subjects. We compared these expression levels to the subjects’ demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, including vascular stiffness. The tested marker genes were expressed in all of samples and organized in hierarchical transcriptional network modules. An index of gene expression in one of these modules (metagene), defined as the average standardized relative copy numbers of 15 pluripotency and cardiovascular differentiation markers, was negatively correlated (all p<0.03) with age (R2=-0.23), vascular stiffness (R2=-0.24), and central aortic pressure (R2=-0.19) and positively correlated with body mass index (R2=0.72, in women). The co-expression of three neovascular markers was validated at the single-cell level using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The overall gene expression in this cardiovascular module was reduced by 72±22% in the patients compared with controls. However, the  compactness of both modules was increased in the patients’ samples, which was reflected in reduced dispersion of their nodes’ degrees of connectivity, suggesting a more primitive character of the patients’ CSPCs. In conclusion, our results show that the relationship between CSPCs and vascular function is encoded in modules of the PBMCs transcriptional network. Furthermore, the coordinated gene expression in these modules can be linked to cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease; thus, this measure may be useful for their diagnosis and prognosis.","PBMCs were isolated from 26 healthy subjects and 20 hypertensive patients by density gradient centrifugation.

GSE50206,Induction of pluripotency in human somatic cells via a primitive streak-like state,24759836,"During mammalian embryonic development, the primitive streak is initiates the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells into germ layers. Pluripotency can be reacquired in committed somatic cells using a combination of handful transcription factors, such as OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (hereafter referred to as OSKM), albeit with low efficiency . Here we   show that, during the OSKM-induced reprogramming process toward pluripotency in human cells, intermediate cells transiently show gene expression profiles resembling mesendoderm, which is a major component of the primitive streak. Based on these findings, we discover that forkhead box H1 (FOXH1), a transcription factor required for anterior primitive streak specification during early development, significantly enhances the reprogramming efficiency of human fibroblasts by promoting their maturation, including the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and the activation of late pluripotent markers. These results demonstrate that during the reprogramming process, human somatic cells go through a transient state that resembles mesendoderm.","Human differentiated progeny derived from pluripotent stem cells, N=13  Human undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, N=6  Transgenic ESC line, N=6  Human tissues, N=29  Human tissue-derived cells, N=20  Human nascent reprogrammed cells, N=95 Mouse cells, N=12",Expression profiling by array,Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version),Takahashi K;Tanabe K;Narita M;Yamanaka S,Kyoto University,Japan,GSM1215621;GSM1215622;GSM1215623;GSM1215624;GSM1215625;GSM1215626;GSM1215627;GSM1215628;GSM1215629;GSM1215630;GSM1215631;GSM1215632;GSM1215633;GSM1215634;GSM1215635;GSM1215636;GSM1215637;GSM1215638;GSM1215639;GSM1215640;GSM1215641;GSM1215642;GSM1215643;GSM1215644;GSM1215645;GSM1215646;GSM1215647;GSM1215648;GSM1215649;GSM1215650;GSM1215651;GSM1215652;GSM1215653;GSM1215654;GSM1215655;GSM1215656;GSM1215657;GSM1215658;GSM1215659;GSM1215660;GSM1215661;GSM1215662;GSM1215663;GSM1215664;GSM1215665;GSM1215666;GSM1215667;GSM1215668;GSM1215669;GSM1215670;GSM1215671;GSM1215672;GSM1215673;GSM1215674;GSM1215675;GSM1215676;GSM1215677;GSM1215678;GSM1215679;GSM1215680;GSM1215681;GSM1215682;GSM1215683;GSM1215684;GSM1215685;GSM1215686;GSM1215687;GSM1215688;GSM1215689;GSM1215690;GSM1215691;GSM1215692;GSM1215693;GSM1215694;GSM1215695;GSM1215696;GSM1215697;GSM1215698;GSM1215699;GSM1215700;GSM1215701;GSM1215702;GSM1215703;GSM1215704;GSM1215705;GSM1215706;GSM1215707;GSM1215708;GSM1215709;GSM1215710;GSM1215711;GSM1215712;GSM1215713;GSM1215714;GSM1215715;GSM1215716;GSM1215717;GSM1215718;GSM1215719;GSM1215720;GSM1215721;GSM1215722;GSM1215723;GSM1215724;GSM1215725;GSM1215726;GSM1215727;GSM1215728;GSM1215729;GSM1215730;GSM1215731;GSM1215732;GSM1215733;GSM1215734;GSM1215735;GSM1215736;GSM1215737;GSM1215738;GSM1215739;GSM1215740;GSM1215741;GSM1215742;GSM1215743;GSM1215744;GSM1215745;GSM1215746;GSM1215747;GSM1215748;GSM1215749;GSM1215750;GSM1215751;GSM1215752;GSM1215753;GSM1215754;GSM1215755;GSM1215756;GSM1215757;GSM1215758;GSM1215759;GSM1215760;GSM1215761;GSM1215762;GSM1215763;GSM1215764;GSM1215765;GSM1215766;GSM1215767;GSM1215768;GSM1215769;GSM1215770;GSM1215771;GSM1215772;GSM1215773;GSM1215774;GSM1215775;GSM1215776;GSM1215777;GSM1215778;GSM1215779;GSM1215780;GSM1215781;GSM1215782;GSM1215783;GSM1215784;GSM1215785;GSM1215786;GSM1215787;GSM1215788;GSM1215789;GSM1330506;GSM1330507;GSM1330508;GSM1330509;GSM1330510;GSM1330511;GSM1330512;GSM1330513;GSM1330514;GSM1330515;GSM1330516;GSM1330517;GSM1330518;GSM1330519;GSM1330520,"Apr 24, 2014","Aug 26, 2013","Feb 02, 2018"

GSE13811,Analysis of gene expression response of CLL cells to co-culture with Nurse like cells,19074730,"In the marrow and lymphatic tissues, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells interact with accessory cells that constitute the leukemia microenvironment. In lymphatic tissues, CLL cells are interspersed with CD68+ nurselike cells (NLC) and T cells. However, the mechanism regulating co-localization of CLL cells and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross-talk between CLL and NLC, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after co-culture with NLC. NLC co-culture induced high-level expression of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and two chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. Supernatants from CLL-NLC co-cultures revealed high CCL3/CCL4 protein levels. B cell receptor triggering also induced a robust induction of CCL3 and CCL4 expression by CLL cells, which was almost completely abrogated by a specific Syc inhibitor, R406. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that activation of this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross-talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment, namely the secretion of two T cell chemokines by CLL-NLC interaction and in response to BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines, CLL cells can recruit accessory cells, and thereby actively create a microenvironment that favors their growth and survival.","The microarray part of this study included samples of CLL cells from 9 different patients, analyzed directly after purification and after 14 days of co-culture with Nurse like cells . In detail, RNA was isolated from CD19-purified CLL cells from 9 different patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after Ficoll separation and subsequent purification with CD19 MicroBeads and the MACS® technology according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For comparison, the same CLL cell samples were co-cultured for 14 days with NLC (""14d NLC"").""). For co-culture with NLC, PBMC from patients with CLL were suspended in complete RPMI medium (RPMI1640 with 10% FCS, penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY) to a concentration of 1 x 107/ml (total 20 ml) and incubated for 14 days in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Techno Plastic Products AG) as described previously3. Nonadherent lymphoid cells then were removed and the NLC layer was washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The complete removal of lymphocytes was verified by phase-contrast microscopy. The nonadherent cells together with the wash-fractions were then used for RNA preparation. In order to purify the CLL B cells prior to RNA isolation, CLL PBMC were passed through a 30 µm nylon mesh to obtain a single-cell suspension. Then CLL B cells were purified with CD19 MicroBeads. Subsequently RNA was extracted.",Expression profiling by array,[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array,Burger JA;Quiroga MP;Hartmann E;Bürkle A;Wierda WG;Keating MJ;Rosenwald A,0931-201-47424,Germany,GSM347177;GSM347178;GSM347179;GSM347190;GSM347192;GSM347195;GSM347329;GSM347331;GSM347333;GSM347334;GSM347336;GSM347338;GSM347339;GSM347341;GSM347343;GSM347344;GSM347345;GSM347346,"Dec 11, 2008","Dec 03, 2008","Mar 25, 2019"
GSE8777,Genetic alteration in recurrent melanoma,18172304,"It is generally accepted that human cancers derive from a mutated single cell. However, the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with heterologous ones and correlated array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed on autologous cell lines and heterologous melanoma cell lines originated from other patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances, global transcriptional patterns and cellular phenotypes; they did not follow a strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis; although their contribution was intertwined, genomic imbalances detectable by aCGH contributed only 25% of the transcriptional traits determining autologous tumors distinctiveness. Our study provides important insights about the dynamics of cancer progression and supports the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies against stable genetic factors determining the individuality of each patient’s disease that are maintained throughout the end stage of disease.Keywords: genetic modification design",PBMC from a female donor were Ficoll gradient separated and used throughout the study as reference.. Validation of array CGH accuracy was done by obtaining six additional PBMC from female donors and six PBMC from male donors to confirm stability of gene representation in autosomes and sex-determined imbalances within the X and Y chromosome regions. Five melanoma cell lines were generated from distinct cutaneous melanoma metastases that progressively appeared in patient 888. Other melanoma cell lines were generated from cutaneous melanoma metastases from other patients. The melanoma cell line A375 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.

GSE4741,Convergence of TCR and IL-7 pathways leads to FOXO3a phosphorylation and drives the survival of C. Memory CD4+ T cells,17190839,"The molecular events that are involved in the establishment and the maintenance of CD4+ Central Memory (TCM) and Effector Memory (TEM) T cells are poorly understood. Using global gene expression profiling, single cell proteomics, and functional assays, we show that the survival of TCM CD4+ T cells involves the activation and phosphorylation of STAT5a and FOXO3a. STAT5a phosphorylation induces the transcriptional up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes specifically in TCM. The phosphorylation of FOXO3a at S315, following TCR engagement, prevents the transcription of pro-apoptotic gene like FasL and BIM. Experiments aimed at blocking FOXO3a phosphorylation confirmed the role of FOXO3a in protecting TCM from apoptosis. Our results define the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the longevity and persistence of CD4+ TCM.Keywords: comparative gene profile, cell-type comparison, central memory to Effector memory","Isolation of CD4+T cell sub-populations. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy adult individuals were isolated by Ficoll-HyPaque (Pharmacia) density gradient. We first enriched for CD4+ T cells using negative immunomagnetic beads selection (Automacs, Myltenii), cells were then labeled with anti-CD4-APCcy7, anti-CD45RA-ECD, anti-CD27-FITC and anti-CCR7-PEcy7 and sorted into Naive cells described as CD4+, CD45RA+, CD27+ and CCR7+, Central Memory cells (TCM) described as CD4+, CD45RA-, CD27+ and CCR7+ cells and Effector Memory cells (TEM) described as CD4+, CD45RA-, CD27- and CCR7- cells.

GSE147928,Characterisation of CD4+ T-cell subtypes using single cell RNA sequencing and the impact of cell number and sequencing depth,33188258,"CD4+ T-cells represent a heterogeneous collection of specialised sub-types and are a key cell type in the pathogenesis of many diseases due to their role in the adaptive immune system. By investigating CD4+ T-cells at the single cell level, using RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), there is the potential to identify specific cell states driving disease or treatment response. However, the impact of sequencing depth and cell numbers, two important factors in scRNA-seq, has not been determined for a complex cell population such as CD4+ T-cells. We therefore generated a high depth, high cell number dataset to determine the effect of reduced sequencing depth and cell number on the ability to accurately identify CD4+ T-cell subtypes. Furthermore, we investigated T-cell signatures under resting and stimulated conditions to assess cluster specific effects of stimulation. We found that firstly, cell number has a much more profound effect than sequencing depth on the ability to classify cells; secondly, this effect is greater when cells are unstimulated and finally, resting and stimulated samples can be combined to leverage additional power whilst still allowing differences between samples to be observed. These results will inform future scRNA-seq studies to ensure the most efficient experimental design.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted from a healthy human volunteer by ficoll density gradient centrifugation. CD4+ T-cells were then isolated and either stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 or left unstimulated. Single cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead v2 kit.
