To explore the effect of the adaptive immune receptor repertoire on thymocyte developmental decisions, we performed single cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) of thymocytes from human young paediatric thymi and blood. Thymic PDCD1(+) cells, a putative CD8[Formula: see text] T cell precursor population, exhibited several TCR features previously associated with thymic and peripheral ZNF683(+) CD8[Formula: see text] T cells, including enrichment of large and positively charged complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) amino acids.

36609611,10.1038/s41467-022-35778-1,"Richter's Transformation (RT) is a poorly understood and fatal progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) manifesting histologically as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is implicated in lymphomagenesis, but its role in CLL or RT progression is unknown. We demonstrate herein that tumors uniformly overexpress PRMT5 in patients with progression to RT. Furthermore, mice with B-specific overexpression of hPRMT5 develop a B-lymphoid expansion with increased risk of death, and Emicro-PRMT5/TCL1 double transgenic mice develop a highly aggressive disease with transformation that histologically resembles RT; where large-scale transcriptional profiling identifies oncogenic pathways mediating PRMT5-driven disease progression. Lastly, we report the development of a SAM-competitive PRMT5 inhibitor, PRT382, with exclusive selectivity and optimal in vitro and in vivo activity compared to available PRMT5 inhibitors. Taken together, the discovery that PRMT5 drives oncogenic pathways promoting RT provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation of PRMT5 inhibitors such as PRT382 in aggressive CLL/RT cases.","Richter's Transformation (RT) is a poorly understood and fatal progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) manifesting histologically as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Here we use systems immunology approaches, including longitudinal multimodal single-cell analysis (surface proteins, transcriptome and V(D)J sequences) to comparatively assess baseline immune statuses and responses to influenza vaccination in 33 healthy individuals after recovery from mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19 (mean, 151 days after diagnosis) and 40 age- and sex-matched control individuals who had never had COVID-19. At the baseline and independent of time after COVID-19, recoverees had elevated T cell activation signatures and lower expression of innate immune genes including Toll-like receptors in monocytes. Male individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 had coordinately higher innate, influenza-specific plasmablast, and antibody responses after vaccination compared with healthy male individuals and female individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, in part because male recoverees had monocytes with higher IL-15 responses early after vaccination coupled with elevated prevaccination frequencies of 'virtual memory'-like CD8(+) T cells poised to produce more IFNgamma after IL-15 stimulation. Moreover, the expression of the repressed innate immune genes in monocytes increased by day 1 to day 28 after vaccination in recoverees, therefore moving towards the prevaccination baseline of the healthy control individuals. By contrast, these genes decreased on day 1 and returned to the baseline by day 28 in the control individuals. Our study reveals sex-dimorphic effects of previous mild COVID-19 and suggests that viral infections in humans can establish new immunological set-points that affect future immune responses in an antigen-agnostic manner.","Acute viral infections can have durable functional impacts on the immune system long after recovery, but how they affect homeostatic immune states and responses to future perturbations remain poorly understood(1-4).

Here, we map the single-cell chromatin landscape of immune cells from blood, normal tumor-adjacent kidney tissue and malignant tissue from patients with early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We catalog the T cell states dictated by tissue-specific and developmental-stage-specific chromatin accessibility patterns, infer key chromatin regulators and observe rewiring of regulatory networks in the progression to dysfunction in CD8(+) T cells. Unexpectedly, among the transcription factors orchestrating the path to dysfunction, NF-kappaB is associated with a pro-apoptotic program in late stages of dysfunction in tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells.

To understand how microenvironmental characteristics alter immune homeostasis and limit immunotherapy efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, here we establish a multi-center single-cell cohort based on public data, containing 357,206 cells from 50 patient samples. We reveal that nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells enhance development and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells via CD70-CD27 interaction. CD70 blocking reverts Treg-mediated suppression and thus reinvigorate CD8+ T-cell immunity. Anti-CD70+ anti-PD-1 therapy is evaluated in xenograft-derived organoids and humanized mice, exhibiting an improved tumor-killing efficacy. Mechanistically, CD70 knockout inhibits a collective lipid signaling network in CD4+ naive and regulatory T cells involving mitochondrial integrity, cholesterol homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, ATAC-Seq delineates that CD70 is transcriptionally upregulated by NFKB2 via an Epstein-Barr virus-dependent epigenetic modification. Our findings identify CD70+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells as a metabolic switch that enforces the lipid-driven development, functional specialization and homeostasis of Tregs, leading to immune evasion. This study also demonstrates that CD70 blockade can act synergistically with anti-PD-1 treatment to reinvigorate T-cell immunity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Despite the intense CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows an unsatisfactory response rate in clinical trials, hindered by immunosuppressive signals.

In this study, we identified a novel TCL subtype which was featured by a unique T cell receptor (TCR) presentation, alpha, beta and gamma chains were co-existing in a single malignant T cell. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old male patient was diagnosed T cell lymphoma after 2-month of abdominal distension and liver enlargement. Combining histology review, PET-CT scanning and immunophenotyes, the patient was not classified to any existing TCL subtypes. To better understand this unclassified TCL case, we performed single cell RNA sequencing paired with TCR sequencing on the patient's PBMC and bone marrow samples. To our surprise, we identified that the malignant T cells had a very rare TCR combination, by expressing two alpha chains, one beta chain and one gamma chain simultaneously. We further studied the molecular pathogenesis and tumor cell heterogeneity of this rare TCL subtype. A set of potential therapeutic targets were identified from the transcriptome data, such as CCL5, KLRG1 and CD38. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the first TCL case co-expressing alpha, beta and gamma chains and dissected its molecular pathogenesis, providing valuable information for precision medicine options for this novel TCL subtype.","BACKGROUND: T cell lymphomas (TCL) are a group of heterogeneous diseases with over 40 subtypes.

Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort, we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as patient-specific regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified 91,601 putative peak-to-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate leukemia-specific genes, such as RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69.

However, the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study, we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with allogeneic ones and correlated array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. aCGH and gene expression profiling were performed on autologous cell lines and allogeneic melanoma cell lines originating from other patients. A striking correlation existed between total extent of genetic imbalances, global transcriptional patterns, and cellular phenotypes. They did not follow a strict temporal progression but stemmed independently at various time points from a central core of genetic stability best explained according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis. Although their contribution was intertwined, genomic imbalances detectable by aCGH contributed only 25% of the transcriptional traits determining autologous tumor distinctiveness.

Here, we evaluated the utility of circulating CX3CR1(+)CD8(+) T cells as a predictive correlate of response to chemo-immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Despite these defenses, some acutely infected cells silence viral transcription to become latently infected and form the HIV reservoir in vivo. Latently infected cells persist through antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are a major barrier to HIV cure. Here, we evaluated innate immunity and IFN responses in multiple T cell models of HIV latency, including established latent cell lines, Jurkat cells latently infected with a reporter virus, and a primary CD4 + T cell model of virologic suppression. RESULTS: We found that while latently infected T cell lines have functional RNA sensing and IFN signaling pathways, they fail to induce specific interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to innate immune activation or type 1 IFN treatment. Jurkat cells latently infected with a fluorescent reporter HIV similarly demonstrate attenuated responses to type 1 IFN. Using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing we applied a functional genomics approach and define ISG expression dynamics in latent HIV infection, including HIV-infected ART-suppressed primary CD4 + T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that HIV latency and viral suppression each link with cell-intrinsic defects in specific ISG induction. We identify a set of ISGs for consideration as latency restriction factors whose expression and function could possibly mitigate establishing latent HIV infection.","BACKGROUND: Innate immunity and type 1 interferon (IFN) defenses are critical for early control of HIV infection within CD4 + T cells. Despite these defenses, some acutely infected cells silence viral transcription to become latently infected and form the HIV reservoir in vivo. Latently infected cells persist through antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are a major barrier to HIV cure.

After the application of immunosuppressants (IS), renal allograft recipients could reach a state called accommodation which means they are neither rejected nor infected. This study aimed to describe the details of this immune accommodation and reveal a novel mechanism of IS on immune cell subpopulations. Methods: We analyzed multiple cell subgroups and their gene expression of peripheral T, B, myeloid, and NK cells from renal allograft recipients with accommodation and healthy control (HC) by single-cell transcriptomics sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Results: A total of 8,272 cells were isolated and sequenced from three individuals, including 2,758 cells from HC, 2,550 cells from ESRD patient, and 2,964 cells from KTx patient, as well as 396 immune response-related genes were detected during sequencing. 5 T-cell, 4 NK-cell, 5 myeloid, and 4 B-cell clusters were defined. Among them, a B-cell subset (CD19(+)IGLC3(low)IGKC(high)TCL1A(-)CD127(+)) of renal transplant recipients with accommodation was significantly lower than that of HC and verified by flow cytometry, and this B-cell subset showed an activated potential because of its high expression of CD127. Furthermore, we found that IL32 might be the key cytokine to induce the differentiation of this B-cell cluster. Conclusion: We found a novel B-cell subset (CD19(+)IGLC3(low)IGKC(high)TCL1A(-)CD127(+)) which was inhibited and decreased in renal allograft recipients with accommodation.

Characteristics of type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in SLE patients have not been well described thus far. METHODS: We analyzed 35,842 cells of PBMC single-cell RNA sequencing data of five SLE patients and three healthy controls. Thereafter, 178 type I ISGs among DEGs of all cell clusters were screened based on the Interferome Database and AUCell package was used for ISGs activity calculation. To determine whether common ISG features exist in PBMCs and kidneys of patients with SLE, we analyzed kidney transcriptomic data from patients with lupus nephritis (LN) from the GEO database. MRL/lpr mice model were used to verify our findings. FINDINGS: We found that monocytes, B cells, dendritic cells, and granulocytes were significantly increased in SLE patients, while subsets of T cells were significantly decreased. Neutrophils and low-density granulocytes (LDGs) exhibited the highest ISG activity. GO and pathway enrichment analyses showed that DEGs focused on leukocyte activation, cell secretion, and pathogen infection. Thirty-one common ISGs were found expressed in both PBMCs and kidneys; these ISGs were also most active in neutrophils and LDGs. Transcription factors including PLSCR1, TCF4, IRF9 and STAT1 were found to be associated to ISGs expression. Consistently, we found granulocyte infiltration in the kidneys of MRL/lpr mice. Granulocyte inhibitor Avacopan reduced granulocyte infiltration and reversed renal conditions in MRL/lpr mice.

Here, we characterized differences in the immune responses by peripheral blood mononuclear cells to various pathogenic stimuli between primates (humans, chimpanzees, and macaques) and bats (Egyptian fruit bats) using single-cell RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We show that the induction patterns of key cytosolic DNA/RNA sensors and antiviral genes differed between primates and bats. A novel subset of monocytes induced by pathogenic stimuli specifically in bats was identified. Furthermore, bats robustly respond to DNA virus infection even though major DNA sensors are dampened in bats. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data suggest that immune responses are substantially different between primates and bats, presumably underlying the difference in viral pathogenicity among the mammalian species tested.","BACKGROUND: Bats harbor various viruses without severe symptoms and act as their natural reservoirs.

Here, we characterized differences in the immune responses by peripheral blood mononuclear cells to various pathogenic stimuli between primates (humans, chimpanzees, and macaques) and bats (Egyptian fruit bats) using single-cell RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We show that the induction patterns of key cytosolic DNA/RNA sensors and antiviral genes differed between primates and bats. A novel subset of monocytes induced by pathogenic stimuli specifically in bats was identified. Furthermore, bats robustly respond to DNA virus infection even though major DNA sensors are dampened in bats. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data suggest that immune responses are substantially different between primates and bats, presumably underlying the difference in viral pathogenicity among the mammalian species tested.","Aso, Hirofumi","Division of Systems Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1088639, Japan.",Gigascience,2022 Dec 28

We demonstrate successful application in four scRNA-seq case studies of different technical and biological types, including 5' and 3' scRNA-seq, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single individual and in multiplex, as well as Perturb-Seq. Benchmarking shows that results from mnSBS-based scRNA-seq are very similar to those using Illumina sequencing, with minor differences in results related to the position of reads relative to annotated gene boundaries, owing to single-end reads of Ultima being closer to gene ends than reads from Illumina. The method is thus compatible with state-of-the-art scRNA-seq libraries independent of the sequencing technology. We expect mnSBS to be of particular utility for cost-effective large-scale scRNA-seq projects.","Here we introduce a mostly natural sequencing-by-synthesis (mnSBS) method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), adapted to the Ultima genomics platform, and systematically benchmark it against current scRNA-seq technology. mnSBS uses mostly natural, unmodified nucleotides and only a low fraction of fluorescently labeled nucleotides, which allows for high polymerase processivity and lower costs.

The immune cell subsets and susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of pSS were analyzed. Flow cytometry was preformed to verify the result of scRNA-seq. RESULTS: We identified two subpopulations significantly expand in pSS patients.

Flow cytometry results showed the percentages of CD4(+) CTLs, which were profiled with CD4(+) and GZMB(+) staining; the total T cells of 10 patients with pSS were significantly higher than those of 10 healthy controls (P= 0.008). The expression level of IL-1beta in macrophages, TCL1A in B cells, as well as interferon (IFN) response genes in most cell subsets was upregulated in the patients with pSS.

Here, we characterized ILCs in PBMC of HCC patients at baseline and after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) by flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing. Characterization of ILC subsets in PBMCs of HCC patients showed a significant increase in ILC1 and a decrease in ILC3 frequencies. Single-cell RNA-sequencing identified a subgroup of NK-like ILCs which expressed cytotoxicity markers as well as NKp80/KLRF1. This KLRF1(high) NK-like population showed low abundance in patients with HCC and was enhanced after combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1immunotherapy. Trajectory analysis placed this population in between ILC1 and ILC3 cells. The transcriptomic signature of KLRF1(high) NK-like ILCs was associated with better progression-free survival in large HCC cohorts. This study shows a previously unknown effect of ICI on the composition and plasticity of ILCS in peripheral blood. Thus, ILCs from PBMC can be used to study changes in the innate immune system under immunotherapy.","Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a heterogeneous and plastic population of cells of the innate immune system.

However, the temporal interactions between individual TFs and their chromatin targets during differentiation and how these interactions dictate lineage commitment remains poorly understood. Here we perform dense, daily, temporal profiling of chromatin accessibility (DNase I-seq) and gene expression changes (total RNA-seq) along ex vivo human erythropoiesis to comprehensively define developmentally regulated DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and transcripts. We link both distal DHSs to their target gene promoters and individual TFs to their target DHSs, revealing that the regulatory landscape is organized in distinct sequential regulatory modules that regulate lineage restriction and maturation. Finally, direct comparison of transcriptional dynamics (bulk and single-cell) and lineage potential between erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis uncovers differential fate commitment dynamics between the two lineages as they exit the stem and progenitor stage. Collectively, these data provide insights into the temporally regulated synergy of the cis- and the trans-regulatory components underlying hematopoietic lineage commitment and differentiation.","Lineage commitment and differentiation is driven by the concerted action of master transcriptional regulators at their target chromatin sites.

This issue is often compounded by limited sample availability and limited prior knowledge of heterogeneity, which can confound data interpretation. RESULTS: Here, we systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines, simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluated methods by their cell recovery rate, library efficiency, sensitivity, and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5' v1 and 3' v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer dropout events, which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.

While the Tumor_2 had relative mild cancer hallmark signatures but expressed genes associated with tumor survival signal and drug resistance (IL32, TOX2, AIF1, AKAP12, CD38 etc.), and eventually became the main tumor subtype post-treatment.

It is also shown that hypoxic stress is a driving factor in immune and metabolic dysfunction of monocytes and erythroid precursors. Last, the data support CD52 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for sepsis as its expression dynamically increases in lymphocytes and correlates with improved sepsis outcomes. In conclusion, this study describes the first single-cell study that analyzed short-term temporal changes in the immune cell populations and their characteristics in surviving or fatal sepsis. Tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes and identify molecular biomarkers and pathways that could be therapeutically controlled to improve the sepsis trajectory toward better outcomes.","Qiu, Xinru","Graduate Program in Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, University of California Riverside, Riverside, California, USA.",J Leukoc Biol,2021 Dec

In this study, we show that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 in uveal melanoma generate such immunogenic neoantigens. Memory CD8(+) T cells specific for these neoantigens are preferentially found in 20% of patients with uveal melanoma bearing SF3B1-mutated tumors. Single-cell analyses of neoepitope-specific T cells from the blood identified large clonal T-cell expansions, with distinct effector transcription patterns. Some of these expanded T-cell receptors are also present in the corresponding tumors. CD8(+) T-cell clones specific for the neoepitopes specifically recognize and kill SF3B1-mutated tumor cells, supporting the use of this new family of neoantigens as therapeutic targets.

We performed a systems biology analysis of samples from the Immunization by Mosquito with Radiation Attenuated Sporozoites (IMRAS) trial, which comprised P. falciparum RAS-immunized (PfRAS), malaria-naive participants whose protection from malaria infection was subsequently assessed by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Blood samples collected after initial PfRAS immunization were analyzed to compare immune responses between protected and non-protected volunteers leveraging integrative analysis of whole blood RNA-seq, high parameter flow cytometry, and single cell CITEseq of PBMCs. This analysis revealed differences in early innate immune responses indicating divergent paths associated with protection. In particular, elevated levels of inflammatory responses early after the initial immunization were detrimental for the development of protective adaptive immunity. Specifically, non-classical monocytes and early type I interferon responses induced within 1 day of PfRAS vaccination correlated with impaired immunity. Non-protected individuals also showed an increase in Th2 polarized T cell responses whereas we observed a trend towards increased Th1 and T-bet+ CD8 T cell responses in protected individuals. Temporal differences in genes associated with natural killer cells suggest an important role in immune regulation by these cells.

30718356,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3309,"PURPOSE: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), encompassing a spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the skin, have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40 years. Sezary syndrome is an aggressive form of CTCL characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for Sezary syndrome reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using single-cell sequencing of RNA and the machine-learning reverse graph embedding approach in the Monocle package, we defined a model featuring distinct transcriptomic states within Sezary syndrome. Gene expression used to differentiate the unique transcriptional states were further used to develop a boosted tree classification for early versus late CTCL disease. RESULTS: Our analysis showed the involvement of FOXP3 (+) malignant T cells during clonal evolution, transitioning from FOXP3 (+) T cells to GATA3 (+) or IKZF2 (+) (HELIOS) tumor cells. Transcriptomic diversities in a clonal tumor can be used to predict disease stage, and we were able to characterize a gene signature that predicts disease stage with close to 80% accuracy. FOXP3 was found to be the most important factor to predict early disease in CTCL, along with another 19 genes used to predict CTCL stage. CONCLUSIONS: This work offers insight into the heterogeneity of Sezary syndrome, providing better understanding of the transcriptomic diversities within a clonal tumor. This transcriptional heterogeneity can predict tumor stage and thereby offer guidance for therapy.","PURPOSE: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), encompassing a spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the skin, have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40 years.

32051003,10.1186/s13059-020-1949-z,"BACKGROUND: Many functional analysis tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events and low library sizes. It is thus not clear if functional TF and pathway analysis tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way. RESULTS: To address this question, we perform benchmark studies on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. We include the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment, and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compare them against the tools SCENIC/AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study, we simulate single cells from TF/pathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. We complement the simulated data with real scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data reveal comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we show that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell type-specific variability by analyzing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq protocols. We also provide the benchmark data for further use by the community. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that bulk-based functional analysis tools that use manually curated footprint gene sets can be applied to scRNA-seq data, partially outperforming dedicated single-cell tools.

METHODS: From September 16 to December 10, 2021, we consecutively enrolled 445 participants (389 patients with AIRD and 56 healthy controls), of whom 236 were immunized with AZD1222 and 209 with mRNA-1273. The serum IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain was quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patients at 4-6 weeks after vaccination for scRNA-seq and further analyzed by CellChat.

17892551,10.1186/1471-2164-8-333,"BACKGROUND: Deep transcriptome analysis will underpin a large fraction of post-genomic biology. 'Closed' technologies, such as microarray analysis, only detect the set of transcripts chosen for analysis, whereas 'open' e.g. tag-based technologies are capable of identifying all possible transcripts, including those that were previously uncharacterized. Although new technologies are now emerging, at present the major resources for open-type analysis are the many publicly available SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) libraries. These technologies have never been compared for their utility in the context of deep transcriptome mining. RESULTS: We used a single LongSAGE library of 503,431 tags and a ""classic"" MPSS library of 1,744,173 tags, both prepared from the same T cell-derived RNA sample, to compare the ability of each method to probe, at considerable depth, a human cellular transcriptome. We show that even though LongSAGE is more error-prone than MPSS, our LongSAGE library nevertheless generated 6.3-fold more genome-matching (and therefore likely error-free) tags than the MPSS library. An analysis of a set of 8,132 known genes detectable by both methods, and for which there is no ambiguity about tag matching, shows that MPSS detects only half (54%) the number of transcripts identified by SAGE (3,617 versus 1,955). Analysis of two additional MPSS libraries shows that each library samples a different subset of transcripts, and that in combination the three MPSS libraries (4,274,992 tags in total) still only detect 73% of the genes identified in our test set using SAGE. The fraction of transcripts detected by MPSS is likely to be even lower for uncharacterized transcripts, which tend to be more weakly expressed. The source of the loss of complexity in MPSS libraries compared to SAGE is unclear, but its effects become more severe with each sequencing cycle (i.e. as MPSS tag length increases). CONCLUSION: We show that MPSS libraries are significantly less complex than much smaller SAGE libraries, revealing a serious bias in the generation of MPSS data unlikely to have been circumvented by later technological improvements. Our results emphasize the need for the rigorous testing of new expression profiling technologies.","BACKGROUND: Deep transcriptome analysis will underpin a large fraction of post-genomic biology.

The source of the loss of complexity in MPSS libraries compared to SAGE is unclear, but its effects become more severe with each sequencing cycle (i.e. as MPSS tag length increases). CONCLUSION: We show that MPSS libraries are significantly less complex than much smaller SAGE libraries, revealing a serious bias in the generation of MPSS data unlikely to have been circumvented by later technological improvements. Our results emphasize the need for the rigorous testing of new expression profiling technologies.","Hene, Lawrence","Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine and MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, The University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK. lawrenceh@hotmail.com",BMC Genomics,2007 Sep 24

Further, analysis of spatially separated samples from the same patient and spatial transcriptomics reveal preferential localization of these healing associated fibroblasts toward the wound bed as compared to the wound edge or unwounded skin. Spatial transcriptomics also validates our findings of higher abundance of M1 macrophages in healers and M2 macrophages in non-healers. Our analysis provides deep insights into the wound healing microenvironment, identifying cell types that could be critical in promoting DFU healing, and may inform novel therapeutic approaches for DFU treatment.","Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is a devastating complication of diabetes whose pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.

 37077913,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1067369,"BACKGROUND: Every bout of exercise mobilizes and redistributes large numbers of effector lymphocytes with a cytotoxic and tissue migration phenotype. The frequent redistribution of these cells is purported to increase immune surveillance and play a mechanistic role in reducing cancer risk and slowing tumor progression in physically active cancer survivors. Our aim was to provide the first detailed single cell transcriptomic analysis of exercise-mobilized lymphocytes and test their effectiveness as a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in xenogeneic mice engrafted with human leukemia. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy volunteers at rest and at the end of an acute bout of cycling exercise. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify phenotypic and transcriptomic differences between resting and exercise-mobilized cells using a targeted gene expression panel curated for human immunology. PBMCs were injected into the tail vein of xenogeneic NSG-IL-15 mice and subsequently challenged with a luciferase tagged chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562). Tumor growth (bioluminescence) and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were monitored bi-weekly for 40-days. RESULTS: Exercise preferentially mobilized NK-cell, CD8+ T-cell and monocyte subtypes with a differentiated and effector phenotype, without significantly mobilizing CD4+ regulatory T-cells. Mobilized effector lymphocytes, particularly effector-memory CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells, displayed differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets associated with anti-tumor activity, including cytotoxicity, migration/chemotaxis, antigen binding, cytokine responsiveness and alloreactivity (e.g. graft-versus-host/leukemia). Mice receiving exercise-mobilized PBMCs had lower tumor burden and higher overall survival (4.14E+08 photons/s and 47%, respectively) at day 40 compared to mice receiving resting PBMCs (12.1E+08 photons/s and 22%, respectively) from the same donors (p&lt;0.05). Human immune cell engraftment was similar for resting and exercise-mobilized DLI. However, when compared to non-tumor bearing mice, K562 increased the expansion of NK-cell and CD3+/CD4-/CD8- T-cells in mice receiving exercise-mobilized but not resting lymphocytes, 1-2 weeks after DLI. No differences in GvHD or GvHD-free survival was observed between groups either with or without K562 challenge. CONCLUSION: Exercise in humans mobilizes effector lymphocytes with an anti-tumor transcriptomic profile and their use as DLI extends survival and enhances the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect without exacerbating GvHD in human leukemia bearing xenogeneic mice. Exercise may serve as an effective and economical adjuvant to increase the GvL effects of allogeneic cell therapies without intensifying GvHD.","BACKGROUND: Every bout of exercise mobilizes and redistributes large numbers of effector lymphocytes with a cytotoxic and tissue migration phenotype.

Surface phenotype and intracellular staining were assessed using flow cytometry after peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells were stimulated with T cell receptor. Single-cell transcriptomes of 6 patients with active AS were studied along with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing. We also assessed the outcome of targeting OX40 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) on the surface of Th17 cells in a mouse model of curdlan-injected SKG mice in which anti-GITR ligand and/or anti-OX40 ligand were used. RESULTS: We identified pathogenic Th17 cells as polyfunctional interleukin-17A (IL-17A)- and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-producing memory CD4+ T cells, with clinically supportive evidence for their pathogenic roles at sites of inflammation in AS.

Collectively, these findings suggest that TNFR2 orchestrates multiple pathways in cancer Tregs, which could help cancer cells escape immune surveillance, making TNFR2 signaling a potential anticancer therapy target.","Okuzono, Yuumi","Immunology Unit, Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555, Japan.",Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,2022 Feb 24

To investigate their regulatory properties, Bregs or total B cells were also co-cultured with T cells and scRNAseq was used to identify receptor ligand interactions and to reveal gene expression changes in the T cells. RESULTS: We find that Bregs exhibit a unique set of 149 genes differentially expressed and which are implicated in proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and altered antigen presentation capacity consistent with their differentiated B cells profile. Notably, Bregs induced a strong inhibition of T cell genes associated to proliferation, activation, inflammation and apoptosis compared to total B cells. We identified and validated 5 receptor/ligand interactions between Bregs and T cells. Functional analysis using specific inhibitors was used to test their suppressive properties and we identified Lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) as a new and potent Breg ligand implicated in Breg suppressive properties.

A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits, P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in resting memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability are central to regulation of the emergence of HIV from latency. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we characterized specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb, defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, such as ingenol and prostratin, stimulated active P-TEFb expression and reactivated latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity, even in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore. Unexpectedly, inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses revealed that of the four known isoforms of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP, RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed diacylglycerol-dependent isoform in CD4+ T cells. RasGRP1 should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 via Ras-Raf signaling upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-mTORC2-AKT-mTORC1 pathway and the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and substantially suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore, contrary to prevailing models, the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells following either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is independent of PKC but rather involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade, namely, RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-mTORC2-AKT-mTORC1.","The switch between HIV latency and productive transcription is regulated by an auto-feedback mechanism initiated by the viral trans-activator Tat, which functions to recruit the host transcription elongation factor P-TEFb to proviral HIV.

Our hypothesis was that the identities and functions of CSPCs in cardiovascular health could be ascertained by analyzing the patterns of their co-expressed markers in unselected PBMC samples. Because gene microarrays had failed to detect many stem cell-associated genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the expression of 45 primitive and tissue differentiation markers in PBMCs from healthy and hypertensive human subjects. We compared these expression levels to the subjects' demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, including vascular stiffness. The tested marker genes were expressed in all of samples and organized in hierarchical transcriptional network modules, constructed by a bottom-up approach. An index of gene expression in one of these modules (metagene), defined as the average standardized relative copy numbers of 15 pluripotency and cardiovascular differentiation markers, was negatively correlated (all p&lt;0.03) with age (R2 = -0.23), vascular stiffness (R2 = -0.24), and central aortic pressure (R2 = -0.19) and positively correlated with body mass index (R2 = 0.72, in women). The co-expression of three neovascular markers was validated at the single-cell level using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The overall gene expression in this cardiovascular module was reduced by 72+/-22% in the patients compared with controls. However, the compactness of both modules was increased in the patients' samples, which was reflected in reduced dispersion of their nodes' degrees of connectivity, suggesting a more primitive character of the patients' CSPCs. In conclusion, our results show that the relationship between CSPCs and vascular function is encoded in modules of the PBMCs transcriptional network. Furthermore, the coordinated gene expression in these modules can be linked to cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease; thus, this measure may be useful for their diagnosis and prognosis.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including rare circulating stem and progenitor cells (CSPCs), have important yet poorly understood roles in the maintenance and repair of blood vessels and perfused organs.

Metastatic and relapsed disease are associated with dismal prognosis. Although effective for some soft tissue sarcomas, current immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of bone sarcomas have been largely ineffective, necessitating a deeper understanding of bone sarcoma immunobiology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of immune infiltration in relapsed versus primary disease was conducted. To better understand immune states and drivers of immune infiltration, especially during disease progression, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of immune populations from paired blood and bone sarcoma tumor samples. RESULTS: Our multiplex immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased immune infiltration in relapsed versus primary disease in both Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. scRNAseq analyses revealed terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells expressing co-inhibitory receptors in osteosarcoma and an effector T-cell subpopulation in Ewing sarcoma. In addition, distinct subsets of CD14+CD16+ macrophages were present in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. To determine pathways driving tumor immune infiltration, we conducted intercellular communication analyses and uncovered shared mechanisms of immune infiltration driven by CD14+CD16+ macrophages and unique pathways of immune infiltration driven by CXCL10 and CXCL12 in osteosarcoma.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multiplex immunofluorescence analysis of immune infiltration in relapsed versus primary disease was conducted. To better understand immune states and drivers of immune infiltration, especially during disease progression, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of immune populations from paired blood and bone sarcoma tumor samples. RESULTS: Our multiplex immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased immune infiltration in relapsed versus primary disease in both Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. scRNAseq analyses revealed terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells expressing co-inhibitory receptors in osteosarcoma and an effector T-cell subpopulation in Ewing sarcoma. In addition, distinct subsets of CD14+CD16+ macrophages were present in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. To determine pathways driving tumor immune infiltration, we conducted intercellular communication analyses and uncovered shared mechanisms of immune infiltration driven by CD14+CD16+ macrophages and unique pathways of immune infiltration driven by CXCL10 and CXCL12 in osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides preclinical rationale for future investigation of specific immunotherapeutic targets upon relapse and provides an invaluable resource of immunologic data from bone sarcomas.","Cillo, Anthony R","Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",Clin Cancer Res,2022 Nov 14

Despite the established importance of B cells and antibodies in preventing infection, the role of B cells in the skin immune response to Borreliella is unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing to immunophenotype EM lesions and their associated B cells and BCR repertoires. We found that B cells were more abundant in EM in comparison with autologous uninvolved skin; many were clonally expanded and had circulating relatives. EM-associated B cells upregulated the expression of MHC class II genes and exhibited preferential IgM isotype usage. A subset also exhibited low levels of somatic hypermutation despite a gene expression profile consistent with memory B cells. Our study demonstrates that single-cell gene expression with paired BCR sequencing can be used to interrogate the sparse B cell populations in human skin and reveals that B cells in the skin infection site in early Lyme disease expressed a phenotype consistent with local antigen presentation and antibody production.","The skin lesion erythema migrans (EM) is an initial sign of the Ixodes tick-transmitted Borreliella spirochetal infection known as Lyme disease.

We studied the binding of vedolizumab to T cells and investigated the functional consequences for dynamic adhesion, transmigration, gut homing and free binding sites in vivo. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterised alpha4beta7 integrin-expressing T cell populations 'resistant' to vedolizumab and validated our findings in vitro and in samples from vedolizumab-treated patients with IBD. We also correlated our findings with a post-hoc analysis of the Gemini II and III studies. RESULTS: Regulatory T (T(Reg)) cells exhibited a right-shifted vedolizumab binding profile compared with effector T (T(Eff)) cells. Consistently, in a certain concentration range, the residual adhesion, transmigration, homing of and availability of functional alpha4beta7 on T(Reg) cells in vivo was higher than that of/on T(Eff) cells. We identified a vedolizumab-'resistant' alpha4beta7-expressing beta1(+)PI16(+) T(Reg) cell subset with pronounced regulatory properties as the substrate for this effect.

36799882,10.1681/ASN.0000000000000083,"SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CKD is accompanied by abnormal inflammation, which contributes to progressive loss of functional renal tissue and accelerated cardiovascular disease. Although studies have documented that dysregulation of monocyte maturation and function is associated with CKD and its complications, it is not well characterized. This study reveals that a distinctive human monocyte subtype with high propensity for releasing proinflammatory mediators and activating endothelial cells is increased in adults with CKD compared with adults with high cardiovascular risk and normal kidney function. It also demonstrates that human monocyte adhesion to endothelial layers and responses to specific inflammatory migration signals are enhanced in CKD. These findings offer insights into the mechanisms of CKD-associated intravascular and localized inflammation and may suggest potential targets for therapeutic interventions. BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CKD is associated with increased circulating intermediate monocytes (IMs). Dysregulation of monocyte maturation and function is associated with CKD and its complications, but it is incompletely characterized. METHODS: To explore monocyte repertoire abnormalities in CKD, we studied properties of monocyte subpopulations, including IM subpopulations distinguished by HLA-DR expression level, in individuals with or without CKD. Using flow cytometry, we profiled monocyte populations in blood samples from adults with CKD, healthy volunteers (HVs), and patient controls (PCs) with high CVD risk. Monocyte subpopulations were also derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of paired blood and biopsy samples from kidney transplant recipients. We quantified intracellular cytokine production, migration, and endothelial adhesion in ex vivo assays of PBMCs. RESULTS: Of four predefined blood monocyte subpopulations, only HLA-DR hi IMs were increased in individuals with CKD compared with HVs and PCs. In HVs and patients with CKD, LPS-stimulated HLA-DR hi IMs isolated from blood produced higher amounts of TNF and IL-1 beta than other monocyte populations. Single-cell analysis revealed four monocyte clusters common to blood and kidneys, including an HLA-DR hi IM-like cluster that was enriched in kidneys versus blood. Migration toward CCL5 and CX3CL1 and adhesion to primary endothelial cell layers were increased in monocyte subpopulations in individuals with CKD compared with HVs. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was partly dependent on CX3CR1/CX3CL1 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with an increased number of a distinctive proinflammatory IM subpopulation and abnormalities of monocyte migration and endothelial adhesion. Dysregulated monocyte maturation and function may represent targetable factors contributing to accelerated CVD in CKD.","SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CKD is accompanied by abnormal inflammation, which contributes to progressive loss of functional renal tissue and accelerated cardiovascular disease.

Here we applied single-cell methods to assess the transcriptional profiles of both malignant T-cell clones and reactive T lymphocytes directly in mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome patient samples. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to profile the T-cell immune repertoire simultaneously with gene expression in CD3+ lymphocytes from mycosis fungoides and healthy skin biopsies as well as from Sezary syndrome and control blood samples.

Coexpressed genes indicate similar functional categories and gene networks. Detecting gene-gene coexpression is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms of cellular function and human diseases. A common practice of identifying coexpressed genes is to test the correlation of expression in a set of genes. In single-cell RNA-seq data, an important challenge is the abundance of zero values, so-called ""dropout"", which results in biased estimation of gene-gene correlations for downstream analyses. In recent years, efforts have been made to recover coexpressed genes in scRNA-seq data. Here, our goal is to detect coexpressed gene pairs to reduce the ""dropout"" effect in scRNA-seq data using a novel graph-based k-partitioning method by merging transcriptomically similar cells. RESULTS: We observed that the number of zero values was reduced among the merged transcriptomically similar cell clusters. Motivated by this observation, we leveraged a graph-based algorithm and develop an R package, scCorr, to recover the missing gene-gene correlation in scRNA-seq data that enables the reliable acquisition of cluster-based gene-gene correlations in three independent scRNA-seq datasets. The graphically partitioned cell clusters did not change the local cell community. For example, in scRNA-seq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the gene-gene correlation estimated by scCorr outperformed the correlation estimated by the nonclustering method.

CD16(+) T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16(+) cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16(+) T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.","Georg, Philipp","Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",Cell,2022 Feb 3

However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by an attenuated challenge virus compares to that associated with a wild-type DENV infection. To determine the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with experimental primary DENV-1 infection and to assess how closely this profile correlates with the transcriptional signature accompanying natural primary DENV-1 infection, we utilized scRNAseq to analyze PBMC from individuals enrolled in a DENV-1 human challenge study and from individuals experiencing a natural primary DENV-1 infection. While both experimental and natural primary DENV-1 infection resulted in overlapping patterns of inflammatory gene upregulation, natural primary DENV-1 infection was accompanied with a more pronounced suppression in gene products associated with protein translation and mitochondrial function, principally in monocytes. This suggests that the immune response elicited by experimental and natural primary DENV infection are similar, but that natural primary DENV-1 infection has a more pronounced impact on basic cellular processes to induce a multi-layered anti-viral state.","Dengue human infection studies present an opportunity to address many longstanding questions in the field of flavivirus biology.

35513850,10.1186/s13073-022-01048-4,"BACKGROUND: Medical digital twins are computational disease models for drug discovery and treatment. Unresolved problems include how to organize and prioritize between disease-associated changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales. We present a dynamic framework that can be used to model such changes and thereby prioritize upstream regulators (URs) for biomarker- and drug discovery. METHODS: We started with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model, by analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SAR patients. Time-series a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of these cells were used to construct multicellular network models (MNMs) at each time point of molecular interactions between cell types. We hypothesized that predicted molecular interactions between cell types in the MNMs could be traced to find an UR gene, at an early time point. We performed bioinformatic and functional studies of the MNMs to develop a scalable framework to prioritize UR genes. This framework was tested on a single-cell and bulk-profiling data from SAR and other inflammatory diseases. RESULTS: Our scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs. CONCLUSIONS: We present a scalable framework for modeling dynamic changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales, to prioritize UR genes for biomarker and drug discovery.","BACKGROUND: Medical digital twins are computational disease models for drug discovery and treatment.

However, the impact of OSA on the heterogeneity of circulating immune cells remains to be determined. METHODS: We applied single-cell transcriptomics analysis (scRNA-seq) to identify OSA-induced changes in transcriptional landscape in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) composition, which uncovered severity-dependent differences in several cell lineages. Furthermore, a machine-learning approach was used to combine scRNAs-seq cell-specific markers with those differentially expressed in OSA. RESULTS: scRNA-seq demonstrated OSA-induced heterogeneity in cellular composition and enabled the identification of previously undescribed cell types in PBMCs. We identified a molecular signature consisting of 32 genes, which distinguished OSA patients from various controls with high precision (area under the curve 0.96) and accuracy (93% positive predictive value and 95% negative predictive value) in an independent PBMC bulk RNA expression dataset. CONCLUSION: OSA deregulates systemic immune function and displays a molecular signature that can be assessed in standard cellular RNA without the need for pre-analytical cell separation, thereby making the assay amenable to application in a molecular diagnostic setting.","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease and a major cause of systemic inflammation leading to neurocognitive, behavioural, metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction in children and adults.

The purpose of our project was to discover the transcription factors (TFs) that were involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at a single-cell resolution using epigenetic technology. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seven RA patients and seven natural controls were extracted nuclei suspensions for library construction. Subsequently, scATAC-seq was performed to generate a high-resolution map of active regulatory DNA for bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: We obtained 22 accessible chromatin patterns. Then, 10 key TFs were involved in RA pathogenesis by regulating the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Consequently, two genes (PTPRC and SPAG9) regulated by 10 key TFs were found, which may be associated with RA disease pathogenesis, and these TFs were obviously enriched in RA patients (P &lt; .05, fold change value &gt; 1.2). With further quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation on PTPRC and SPAG9 in monocytes, we found differential expression of these two genes, which were regulated by eight TFs [ZNF384, HNF1B, DMRTA2, MEF2A, NFE2L1, CREB3L4 (var. 2), FOSL2::JUNB (var. 2), and MEF2B], showing highly accessible binding sites in RA patients.

Specifically, we observed and validated preferential sensitivity to proteasome, PLK1, and mTOR inhibitors during ibrutinib treatment. More generally, our study establishes a broadly applicable method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug responses in primary patient samples.","Schmidl, Christian","CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.",Nat Chem Biol,2019 Mar

We identified 2 highly distinct stem-like states that critically differed with regard to cell cycle and oncogenic signaling.

Remarkably, we found that both stem-like states could differentiate into a more mature leukemia state with prominent immunomodulatory functions, including high expression of the LGALS9 checkpoint molecule. These cells promoted an immunosuppressive leukemia ecosystem with clonal accumulation of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that expressed HAVCR2, the cognate receptor for LGALS9. Our study identified complex interactions between signaling programs, cellular plasticity, and immune programs that characterize ETP-ALL, illustrating the multidimensionality of tumor heterogeneity.

In addition, a clinically relevant application of RevGel-seq is presented for pancreatic islet cells. Furthermore, characterizations carried out on cardiomyocytes demonstrate that the hydrogel technology readily accommodates very large cells. Standard analyses are in the 10,000-input cell range with the current gelation device, in order to satisfy common requirements for single-cell research. A convenient stopping point after two hours has been established by freezing at the cell lysis step, with full preservation of gene expression profiles.

Cell lysis is triggered by detergent diffusion, and RNA molecules are captured on the adjacent barcoded beads for further processing with reverse transcription and preparation for cDNA sequencing. As a proof of concept, analysis of PBMC using RevGel-seq achieves results similar to microfluidic-based technologies when using the same original sample and the same data analysis software. In addition, a clinically relevant application of RevGel-seq is presented for pancreatic islet cells. Furthermore, characterizations carried out on cardiomyocytes demonstrate that the hydrogel technology readily accommodates very large cells. Standard analyses are in the 10,000-input cell range with the current gelation device, in order to satisfy common requirements for single-cell research. A convenient stopping point after two hours has been established by freezing at the cell lysis step, with full preservation of gene expression profiles. Overall, our results show that RevGel-seq represents an accessible and efficient instrument-free alternative, enabling flexibility in terms of experimental design and timing of sample processing, while providing broad coverage of cell types.","Komatsu, Jun","Scipio Bioscience, Paris, France.",Sci Rep,2023 Mar 24

Single-cell small RNA sequencing can be used to profile small RNAs of individual cells; however, limitations of efficiency and scale prevent its widespread application. Here, we developed parallel single-cell small RNA sequencing (PSCSR-seq), which can overcome the limitations of existing methods and enable high-throughput small RNA expression profiling of individual cells. Analysis of PSCSR-seq data indicated that diverse cell types could be identified based on patterns of miRNA expression, and showed that miRNA content in nuclei is informative (for example, cell type marker miRNAs can be detected in isolated nuclei). PSCSR-seq is very sensitive: analysis of only 732 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) detected 774 miRNAs, whereas bulk small RNA analysis would require input RNA from approximately 10(6) cells to detect as many miRNAs. We identified 42 miRNAs as markers for PBMC subpopulations. Moreover, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of 9,533 cells from lung cancer biopsies, and by dissecting cell subpopulations, we identified potentially diagnostic and therapeutic miRNAs for lung cancers. Our study demonstrates that PSCSR-seq is highly sensitive and reproducible, thus making it an advanced tool for miRNA analysis in cancer and life science research.","miRNA and other forms of small RNAs are known to regulate many biological processes.

METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing of donor and recipient DNA and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of five human kidney transplant biopsy cores distinguished immune cell contributions from both participants. DNA-sequence comparisons used single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified in the exome sequences across all samples. RESULTS: Analysis of expressed SNVs in the scRNA-seq data set distinguished recipient versus donor origin for all 81,139 cells examined. The leukocyte donor/recipient ratio varied with rejection status for macrophages and with time post-transplant for lymphocytes. Recipient macrophages displayed inflammatory activation whereas donor macrophages demonstrated antigen presentation and complement signaling. Recipient-origin T cells expressed cytotoxic and proinflammatory genes consistent with an effector cell phenotype, whereas donor-origin T cells appeared quiescent, expressing oxidative phosphorylation genes. Finally, both donor and recipient T cell clones within the rejecting kidney suggested lymphoid aggregation. The results indicate that donor-origin macrophages and T cells have distinct transcriptional profiles compared with their recipient counterparts, and that donor macrophages can persist for years post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of single nucleotide variants and their expression in single cells provides a powerful novel approach to accurately define leukocyte chimerism in a complex organ such as a transplanted kidney, coupled with the ability to examine transcriptional profiles at single-cell resolution.","BACKGROUND: In solid organ transplantation, donor-derived immune cells are assumed to decline with time after surgery.

Currently the only treatment that can modify the disease is antigen-specific immunotherapy, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: We comprehensively investigated the role and changes of antigen-specific T cells before and after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for Japanese cedar pollinosis. METHODS: We cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained both before and 1 year after initiating SLIT and used a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire sequencing. To investigate biomarkers, we used cells from patients participating a phase 2/3 trial of SLIT tablets for Japanese cedar pollinosis and cells from outpatients with good and poor response. RESULTS: Antigen-stimulated culturing after SLIT led to clonal expansion of T(H)2 and regulatory T cells, and most of these CD4(+) T cells retained their CDR3 regions before and after treatment, indicating antigen-specific clonal responses and differentiation resulting from SLIT. However, SLIT reduced the number of clonal functional T(H)2 cells but increased the trans-type T(H)2 cell population that expresses musculin (MSC), TGF-beta, and IL-2. Trajectory analysis suggested that SLIT induced clonal differentiation of the trans-type T(H)2 cells differentiated into regulatory T cells. Using real-time PCR, we found that the MSC levels increased in the active SLIT group and those with good response after 1 year of treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and repertoire analysis helped reveal part of the underlying mechanism: SLIT promotes the expression of MSC on pathogenic T(H)2 cells and suppresses their function. MSC may be a potential biomarker of SLIT for allergic rhinitis.","BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is a growing problem worldwide.

These findings indicate one of the specific chromatin remodeling and differentiation programs of T(reg) cells in the TME, which can be applied in the development of T(reg) cell-targeted therapies.","Itahashi, Kota","Division of Cancer Immunology, Research Institute/Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center (EPOC), National Cancer Center, Tokyo 104-0045/Chiba 277-8577, Japan.",Sci Immunol,2022 Oct 14

Here, we used multi-omic approaches to comprehensively decipher the immune disturbance in a male HIES patient harboring STAT3-V637M.

35025971,10.1371/journal.ppat.1010219,"Excessive inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many viral infections including influenza. Therefore, there is a need for therapeutic interventions that dampen and redirect inflammatory responses and, ideally, exert antiviral effects. Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite which also reprograms cell metabolism and inflammatory responses when applied exogenously. We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous application of itaconate and its variants dimethyl- and 4-octyl-itaconate (DI, 4OI) on host responses to influenza A virus (IAV). Infection induced expression of ACOD1, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis, in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by DI and 4OI treatment. In IAV-infected mice, pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than in wild-type mice, and DI treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and mortality. The compounds reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in human cells supporting non-productive and productive infection, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in human lung tissue. All three itaconates reduced ROS levels and STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas AKT phosphorylation was reduced by 4OI and DI but increased by itaconate. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified monocytes as the main target of infection and the exclusive source of ACOD1 mRNA in peripheral blood. DI treatment silenced IFN-responses predominantly in monocytes, but also in lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ectopic synthesis of itaconate in A549 cells, which do not physiologically express ACOD1, reduced infection-driven inflammation, and DI reduced IAV- and IFNgamma-induced CXCL10 expression in murine macrophages independent of the presence of endogenous ACOD1. The compounds differed greatly in their effects on cellular gene homeostasis and released cytokines/chemokines, but all three markedly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses. In fact, 4OI strongly inhibited viral transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the compounds reduced viral titers (4OI&gt;Ita&gt;DI) in A549 cells whereas viral transcription was unaffected.

SEC61A1 encodes the alpha-subunit of the Sec61 complex, which governs endoplasmic reticulum protein transport and passive calcium leakage. Recently, mutations in SEC61A1 were reported to be pathogenic in common variable immunodeficiency and glomerulocystic kidney disease. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to expand the spectrum of SEC61A1-mediated disease to include autosomal dominant SCN. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing findings were validated, and reported mutations were compared by Western blotting, Ca2(+) flux assays, differentiation of transduced HL-60 cells, in vitro differentiation of primary CD34 cells, quantitative PCR for unfolded protein response (UPR) genes, and single-cell RNA sequencing on whole bone marrow. RESULTS: We identified a novel de novo missense mutation in SEC61A1 (c.A275G;p.Q92R) in a patient with SCN who was born to nonconsanguineous Belgian parents. The mutation results in diminished protein expression, disturbed protein translocation, and an increase in calcium leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum. In vitro differentiation of CD34(+) cells recapitulated the patient's clinical arrest in granulopoiesis. The impact of Q92R-Sec61alpha1 on neutrophil maturation was validated by using HL-60 cells, in which transduction reduced differentiation into CD11b(+)CD16(+) cells. A potential mechanism for this defect is the uncontrolled initiation of the unfolded protein stress response, with single-cell analysis of primary bone marrow revealing perturbed UPR in myeloid precursors and in vitro differentiation of primary CD34(+) cells revealing upregulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein UPR-response genes. CONCLUSION: Specific mutations in SEC61A1 cause SCN through dysregulation of the UPR.","BACKGROUND: The molecular cause of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is unknown in 30% to 50% of patients.

Furthermore, we show that HSCs partition into topographically diametric lobule regions, designated portal vein-associated HSCs (PaHSCs) and central vein-associated HSCs (CaHSCs). Importantly we uncover functional zonation, identifying CaHSCs as the dominant pathogenic collagen-producing cells in a mouse model of centrilobular fibrosis. Finally, we identify LPAR1 as a therapeutic target on collagen-producing CaHSCs, demonstrating that blockade of LPAR1 inhibits liver fibrosis in a rodent NASH model. Taken together, our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to resolve the key collagen-producing cells driving liver fibrosis with high precision.","Iterative liver injury results in progressive fibrosis disrupting hepatic architecture, regeneration potential, and liver function.

Pluripotency can be reacquired in committed somatic cells using a combination of a handful of transcription factors, such as OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (hereafter referred to as OSKM), albeit with low efficiency. Here we show that during OSKM-induced reprogramming towards pluripotency in human cells, intermediate cells transiently show gene expression profiles resembling mesendoderm, which is a major component of the primitive streak. Based on these findings, we discover that forkhead box H1 (FOXH1), a transcription factor required for anterior primitive streak specification during early development, significantly enhances the reprogramming efficiency of human fibroblasts by promoting their maturation, including mesenchymal to epithelial transition and the activation of late pluripotency markers.

Multiple cell types have been implicated in such response impairment and may be responsible for asthma immunopathology. However, existing models to study the immune response in asthma are limited by bulk profiling of cells. Our objective was to Characterize a model of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with severe asthma (SA) and its response to the TLR3 agonist Poly I:C using two single-cell methods. METHODS: Two complementary single-cell methods, DropSeq for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), were used to profile PBMCs of SA patients and healthy controls (HC). Poly I:C-stimulated and unstimulated cells were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: PBMCs (n = 9414) from five SA (n = 6099) and three HC (n = 3315) were profiled using scRNA-Seq. Six main cell subsets, namely CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes, were identified. CD4 + T cells were the main cell type in SA and demonstrated a pro-inflammatory profile characterized by increased JAK1 expression. Following Poly I:C stimulation, PBMCs from SA had a robust induction of interferon pathways compared with HC. CyTOF profiling of Poly I:C stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs (n = 160,000) from the same individuals (SA = 5; HC = 3) demonstrated higher CD8 + and CD8 + effector T cells in SA at baseline, followed by a decrease of CD8 + effector T cells after poly I:C stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell profiling of an in vitro model using PBMCs in patients with SA identified activation of pro-inflammatory pathways at baseline and strong response to Poly I:C, as well as quantitative changes in CD8 + effector cells. Thus, transcriptomic and cell quantitative changes are associated with immune cell heterogeneity in this model to evaluate interferon responses in severe asthma.","BACKGROUND: Asthma has been associated with impaired interferon response.

By evaluating human CD8(+) T cells from responders versus nonresponders to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we sought to identify key factors associated with effective CTL function. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of peripheral CD8(+) T cells from patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy showed that cells from nonresponders exhibited decreased expression of the cytolytic granule-associated molecule natural killer cell granule protein-7 (NKG7). Functional assays revealed that reduced NKG7 expression altered cytolytic granule number, trafficking, and calcium release, resulting in decreased CD8(+) T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. Transfection of T cells with NKG7 mRNA was sufficient to improve the tumor-cell killing ability of human T cells isolated from nonresponders and increase their response to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy in vitro. NKG7 mRNA therapy also improved the antitumor activity of murine tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in an in vivo model of adoptive cell therapy. Finally, we showed that the transcription factor ETS1 played a role in regulating NKG7 expression. Together, our results identify NKG7 as a necessary component for the cytotoxic function of CD8(+) T cells and establish NKG7 as a T-cell-intrinsic therapeutic target for enhancing cancer immunotherapy.See related article by Li et al., p. 154.","Cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells (CTL) are a crucial component of the immune system notable for their ability to eliminate rapidly proliferating malignant cells.

Their role and function in response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy have also not been explored. Here, we characterized ILCs in PBMC of HCC patients at baseline and after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) by flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing. Characterization of ILC subsets in PBMCs of HCC patients showed a significant increase in ILC1 and a decrease in ILC3 frequencies. Single-cell RNA-sequencing identified a subgroup of NK-like ILCs which expressed cytotoxicity markers as well as NKp80/KLRF1. This KLRF1(high) NK-like population showed low abundance in patients with HCC and was enhanced after combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1immunotherapy. Trajectory analysis placed this population in between ILC1 and ILC3 cells. The transcriptomic signature of KLRF1(high) NK-like ILCs was associated with better progression-free survival in large HCC cohorts. This study shows a previously unknown effect of ICI on the composition and plasticity of ILCS in peripheral blood. Thus, ILCs from PBMC can be used to study changes in the innate immune system under immunotherapy.","Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a heterogeneous and plastic population of cells of the innate immune system.

Building a bridge between these genes and biologically targeted therapies is the current research hotspot. METHODS: We integrated single-cell assaying transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore the key genes and related mechanisms associated with AS pathogenesis. RESULTS: We identified 18 cell types in peripheral mononuclear cells from patients with AS and normal controls and summarized the cell-type-specific abnormal genes by scRNA-seq. Interestingly, we found that the pathogenic gene NFKB involved in AS progression originated from CD8+ T cells. Moreover, we observed an abnormal tumor TNF pathway mediated by abnormal expression of TNF, NFKB, FOS, JUN, and JUNB, and scATAC-seq results confirmed the abnormal accessible binding sites of transcriptional factors FOS, JUN, and JUNB. The final magnetic bead sorting and quantitative real-time PCR(RT-qPCR) confirmed that NFKB, FOS, JUN, and JUNB in CD8+ T cells differed in the AS group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed a possible mechanism by which NFKB abnormally regulates FOS, JUN, and JUNB and drives AS progression, providing a novel perspective from a single cell point of view in AS.","OBJECTIVE: Genetic studies on ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have identified more than 100 pathogenic genes.

Our cluster analysis revealed four pDC clusters: pDC1, pDC2, cytotoxic-like pDC and an exhausted pDC cluster. The inducible cytotoxic-like pDC cluster is characterized by high expression of both antiviral and cytotoxic genes.

The TNFR2(+) Treg infiltration level in the tumor microenvironment increased significantly as gastric cancer progressed and was demonstrated to be a prognostic marker. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed high levels of TNFR2 in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. The TNF-alpha/TNFR2 signaling pathway was activated, accompanied by the upregulation of costimulatory molecules. Unlike blood Tregs, tumor-infiltrating Tregs existed in activated and effector states. In addition to expressing costimulatory molecules such as TNFR2, 4-1BB, OX40 and GITR, tumor-infiltrating Tregs were also characterized by high expression levels of immune checkpoints such as CTLA-4 and TIGIT and chemokines such as CCR6. In vitro studies showed that the TNF-alpha/TNFR2 pathway increased the Foxp3 expression in CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells and the latent TGF-beta production in Tregs as well as enhanced the immunosuppressive function of Tregs. In summary, our study revealed high infiltration levels of TNFR2(+) Tregs that were in activated and effector states in the tumor microenvironment.

Here we analysed the human CD8 T cell response to yellow fever vaccination as the best-known model to study the human immune response to acute viral infection. We performed flow cytometry on 21 markers conventionally used in mice and in humans to describe differentiation, activation, cycling, and so-called effector functions. We found clearly distinct 'acute traits' at the peak of the response that are shared amongst all non-naive antigen-specific subsets, including memory-differentiated cells. These acute traits were low BCL-2 and high KI67, CD38, HLA-DR, as well as increased Granzyme B and Perforin, previously attributed only to effector cells at the peak of the response. Furthermore, analysis of chromatin accessibility at the single cell level revealed that memory- and effector-differentiated cells clustered together specifically in the acute phase.

Following unbiased clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified for 18 cell types and bioinformatically assessed for function and pathway enrichment. Our results reveal persistent activation of circulating classical monocytes with subsequent upregulation of trafficking molecules. Specifically, classical monocytes upregulated distinct markers of activation including adhesion molecules, pattern recognition receptors, and chemokine receptors, as well as enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways HMGB1, mTOR, and ephrin receptor signaling. Predictive modeling implicated TGFbeta and mTOR signaling as drivers of persistent monocyte activation. Additionally, sarcoidosis T cell subsets displayed patterns of dysregulation. CD4 naive T cells were enriched for markers of apoptosis and Th17/T(reg) differentiation, while effector T cells showed enrichment of anergy-related pathways. Differentially expressed genes in regulatory T cells suggested dysfunctional p53, cell death, and TNFR2 signaling.

The effect of IL-11 in-vitro stimulation, examined using single-cell RNA sequencing, revealed the highest number of differentially expressed genes in classical monocytes, including up-regulated NFKB1, NLRP3, and IL1B. All CD4(+) cell subsets had increased expression of S100A8/9 alarmin genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Therapeutic targeting of this pathway with alphaIL-11 mAb in mice with RR experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) decreased clinical scores, CNS inflammatory infiltrates, and demyelination. alphaIL-11 mAb treatment decreased the numbers of NFkappaBp65(+), NLRP3(+), and IL-1beta(+) monocytes in the CNS of mice with EAE.

Tissue resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have been suggested to control tumour surveillance. Here, we studied how the local cytokine milieu controls ILCs in HCC. DESIGN: We performed bulk RNA sequencing of HCC tissue as well as flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched ILCs from non-tumour liver, margin and tumour core derived from 48 patients with HCC. Simultaneous measurement of protein and RNA expression at the single-cell level (AbSeq) identified precise signatures of ILC subgroups. In vitro culturing of ILCs was used to validate findings from in silico analysis. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from large HCC cohorts allowed stratification and survival analysis based on transcriptomic signatures. RESULTS: RNA sequencing of tumour, non-tumour and margin identified tumour-dependent gradients, which were associated with poor survival and control of ILC plasticity. Single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry of ILCs from HCC livers identified natural killer (NK)-like cells in the non-tumour tissue, losing their cytotoxic profile as they transitioned into tumour ILC1 and NK-like-ILC3 cells. Tumour ILC composition was mediated by cytokine gradients that directed ILC plasticity towards activated tumour ILC2s. This was liver-specific and not seen in ILCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with high ILC2/ILC1 ratio expressed interleukin-33 in the tumour that promoted ILC2 generation, which was associated with better survival. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the tumour cytokine milieu controls ILC composition and HCC outcome.

Lineage-specific deletion of layilin on murine CD8+ T cells reduced their accumulation in tumors and increased tumor growth in vivo. Congruently, gene editing of LAYN in human CD8+ T cells reduced direct tumor cell killing ex vivo. On a molecular level, layilin colocalized with integrin alphaLbeta2 (LFA-1) on T cells, and cross-linking layilin promoted the activated state of this integrin.

Together, these observations offer novel insight into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of diagnostic tools for COVID-19.","Giroux, Nicholas S","Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.",Sci Rep,2022 Jul 9

However, the immunological signature and the exact gene expression program by which the presence of CHIP exerts its clinical impact on COVID-19 remain to be elucidated. In this study, we generated a single-cell transcriptome landscape of severe COVID-19 according to the presence of CHIP using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with CHIP exhibited a potent IFN-gamma response in exacerbating inflammation, particularly in classical monocytes, compared to patients without CHIP. To dissect the regulatory mechanism of CHIP (+)-specific IFN-gamma response gene expression in severe COVID-19, we identified DNMT3A CHIP mutation-dependent differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and annotated their putative target genes based on long-range chromatin interactions. We revealed that CHIP mutant-driven hypo-DMRs at poised cis-regulatory elements appear to facilitate the CHIP (+)-specific IFN-gamma-mediated inflammatory immune response. Our results highlight that the presence of CHIP may increase the susceptibility to hyperinflammation through the reorganization of chromatin architecture, establishing a novel subgroup of severe COVID-19 patients.","Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common aging-related process that predisposes individuals to various inflammatory responses, has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 severity.

Our goal was to reveal the chromatin accessibility landscape of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in SLE patients at single-cell resolution and identify the transcription factors (TFs) that may drive abnormal immune responses. METHODS: The assay for transposase accessible chromatin in single-cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) method was applied to map the landscape of active regulatory DNA in immune cells from SLE patients at single-cell resolution, followed by clustering, peak annotation and motif analysis of PBMCs in SLE. RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were robustly clustered based on their types without using antibodies. We identified twenty patterns of TF activation that drive abnormal immune responses in SLE patients. Then, we observed ten genes that were highly associated with SLE pathogenesis by altering T cell activity. Finally, we found 12 key TFs regulating the above six genes (CD83, ELF4, ITPKB, RAB27A, RUNX3, and ZMIZ1) that may be related to SLE disease pathogenesis and were significantly enriched in SLE patients (p &lt;0.05, FC &gt;2). With qPCR experiments on CD83, ELF4, RUNX3, and ZMIZ1 in B cells, we observed a significant difference in the expression of genes (ELF4, RUNX3, and ZMIZ1), which were regulated by seven TFs (EWSR1-FLI1, MAF, MAFA, NFIB, NR2C2 (var. 2), TBX4, and TBX5). Meanwhile, the seven TFs showed highly accessible binding sites in SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the importance of using single-cell sequencing to uncover the real features of immune cells in SLE patients, reveal key TFs in SLE-PBMCs, and provide foundational insights relevant for epigenetic therapy.","OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease, and various immune cells are involved in the initiation, progression, and regulation of SLE.

High CCL3/CCL4 protein levels were found in CLL cocultures with NLCs, and CCL3/CCL4 induction was abrogated by R406, a Syk inhibitor, suggesting that NLCs induce these chemokines via B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. BCR triggering also caused robust CCL3/CCL4 protein secretion by CLL cells. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that this pathway plays a role in vivo.

UC was associated with an increase in IgG1(+) plasma cells in colonic tissue, increased colonic regulatory T cells characterized by elevated expression of the transcription factor ZEB2, and an enrichment of a gammadelta T cell subset in the peripheral blood. Moreover, we observed heterogeneity in CD8(+) tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells in colonic tissue, with four transcriptionally distinct states of differentiation observed across health and disease. In the setting of UC, there was a marked shift of clonally related CD8(+) T(RM) cells toward an inflammatory state, mediated, in part, by increased expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin.

Reference transcriptomes for M1 and M2 macrophages were generated by in vitro differentiation of healthy blood-derived monocytes and applied to assess the inflammatory properties of TAMs. We analyzed 180 cells, including tumor cells, macrophages, and mesothelial cells. Dynamic exchange of tumor-promoting signals, including the CCL3-CCR1 or IL1B-IL1R2 interactions, suggests macrophage recruitment and anti-inflammatory tuning by tumor cells. By comparing these data with reference transcriptomes for M1-type and M2-type macrophages, we found noninflammatory characteristics in macrophages recovered from the malignant ascites of GC.

37197660,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1132807,"INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In this study we report that sequential treatment of supercharged NK (sNK) cells with either chemotherapeutic drugs or check-point inhibitors eliminate both poorly differentiated and well differentiated tumors in-vivo in humanized-BLT mice. BACKGROUND AND RESULTS: sNK cells were found to be a unique population of activated NK cells with genetic, proteomic, and functional attributes that are very different from primary untreated or IL-2 treated NK cells. Furthermore, NK-supernatant differentiated or well-differentiated oral or pancreatic tumor cell lines are not susceptible to IL-2 activated primary NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; however, they are greatly killed by the CDDP and paclitaxel in in-vitro assays. Injection of one dose of sNK cells at 1 million cells per mouse to aggressive CSC-like/poorly differentiated oral tumor bearing mice, followed by an injection of CDDP, inhibited tumor weight and growth, and increased IFN-gamma secretion as well as NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity substantially in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood derived immune cells. Similarly, the use of check point inhibitor anti-PD-1 antibody increased IFN-gamma secretion and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and decreased the tumor burden in-vivo, and tumor growth of resected minimal residual tumors from hu-BLT mice when used sequentially with sNK cells. The addition of anti-PDL1 antibody to poorly differentiated MP2, NK-differentiated MP2 or well-differentiated PL-12 pancreatic tumors had different effects on tumor cells depending on the differentiation status of the tumor cells, since differentiated tumors expressed PD-L1 and were susceptible to NK cell mediated ADCC, whereas poorly differentiated OSCSCs or MP2 did not express PD-L1 and were killed directly by the NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the ability to target combinatorially clones of tumors with NK cells and chemotherapeutic drugs or NK cells with checkpoint inhibitors at different stages of tumor differentiation may be crucial for successful eradication and cure of cancer. Furthermore, the success of check point inhibitor PD-L1 may relate to the levels of expression on tumor cells.","INTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In this study we report that sequential treatment of supercharged NK (sNK) cells with either chemotherapeutic drugs or check-point inhibitors eliminate both poorly differentiated and well differentiated tumors in-vivo in humanized-BLT mice.

Investigation of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment can be highly informative but access to tumor tissue is not always available, highlighting the need to identify biomarkers in the blood that correlate with clinical success. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor sequencing to define CD8(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood of two patients with melanoma before and after immunotherapy with either anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) alone or the combination of anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab). Both treatment regimens increased transcripts associated with cytolytic effector function and decreased transcripts associated with naive T cells. These responses were further evaluated at the protein level and extended to a total of 53 patients with various cancer types. Unexpectedly, the induction of CD8(+) T cell responses associated with cytolytic function was variable and did not predict therapeutic success in this larger patient cohort. Rather, a decrease in the frequency of T cells with a naive-like phenotype was consistently observed after immunotherapy and correlated with prolonged patient survival. In contrast, a more detailed clonotypic analysis of emerging and expanding CD8(+) T cells in the blood revealed that a majority of individual T cell clones responding to immunotherapy acquired a transcriptional profile consistent with cytolytic effector function. These results suggest that responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy are evident and traceable in patients' blood, with outcomes predicted by the simultaneous loss of naive-like CD8(+) T cells and the expansion of mostly rare and diverse cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell clones.","Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has become a first-line treatment option for cancer patients, with success in increasingly diverse cancer types.

To define B cell function we performed phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing on a cohort of children with MtD (N = 19) and controls (N = 16). RESULTS: Via scRNAseq, we found marked reductions in select populations involved in the humoral immune response, especially antigen presenting cells, B cell and plasma populations, with sparing of T cell populations. MTRNR2L8, a marker of bioenergetic stress, was significantly elevated in populations that were most depleted. mir4485, a miRNA contained in the intron of MTRNR2L8, was co-expressed. Knockdown studies of mir4485 demonstrated its role in promoting survival by modulating apoptosis. To determine the functional consequences of our findings on humoral immunity, we studied the antiviral antibody repertoire in children with MtD and controls using phage display and immunoprecipitation sequencing. Despite similar viral exposomes, MtD displayed antiviral antibodies with less robust fold changes and limited polyclonality.

In this study, we find that pATB administration is consistently associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in multiple cohorts consisting of patients with AGC treated with PD-1 inhibitors. In contrast, pATB does not affect outcomes among patients treated with irinotecan. Multivariable analysis of the overall patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors confirms that pATB administration independently predicts worse PFS and OS. Administration of pATBs is associated with diminished gut microbiome diversity, reduced abundance of Lactobacillus gasseri, and disproportional enrichment of circulating exhaustive CD8(+) T cells, all of which are associated with worse outcomes. Considering the inferior treatment response and poor survival outcomes by pATB administration followed by PD-1 blockade, ATBs should be prescribed with caution in patients with AGC who are planning to receive PD-1 inhibitors.","Evidence on whether prior antibiotic (pATB) administration modulates outcomes of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is scarce.

KIR3DL3 is a conserved but polymorphic inhibitory KIR recognizing a B7 family ligand, HHLA2, and is implicated for immune checkpoint targeting. The expression profile and biological function of KIR3DL3 have been somewhat elusive, so we searched extensively for KIR3DL3 transcripts, revealing highly enriched expression in gammadelta and CD8(+) T cells rather than NK cells. These KIR3DL3-expressing cells are rare in the blood and thymus but more common in the lungs and digestive tract. High-resolution flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptomics showed that peripheral blood KIR3DL3(+) T cells have an activated transitional memory phenotype and are hypofunctional. The T cell receptor (TCR) usage is biased toward genes from early rearranged TCR-alpha variable segments or Vdelta1 chains. In addition, we show that TCR-mediated stimulation can be inhibited through KIR3DL3 ligation. Whereas we detected no impact of KIR3DL3 polymorphism on ligand binding, variants in the proximal promoter and at residue 86 can reduce expression. Together, we demonstrate that KIR3DL3 is up-regulated alongside unconventional T cell stimulation and that individuals may vary in their ability to express KIR3DL3. These results have implications for the personalized targeting of KIR3DL3/HHLA2 checkpoint inhibition.","Most human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and recognize HLA class I molecules as ligands.

In almost all reported works investigators have used live cells, which introduces cell stress during preparation and hinders complex study designs. Recent studies have indicated that cells fixed by denaturing fixative can be used in single-cell sequencing, however they did not usually work with most types of primary cells including immune cells. METHODS: The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10x Chromium platform. RESULTS: When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps: fixation, storage and rehydration, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to 3-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3x saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3x SSC were successfully implemented into 10x Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol also worked in several other fixed primary cell types and cell lines as in live ones. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will allow better and more effective batching schemes for a complex single cell experimental design with primary cells or tissues.","BACKGROUND: Interest in single-cell transcriptomic analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells.

However, high assay costs and artifacts associated with analyzing samples across multiple sequencing runs limit the study of large numbers of samples. Sample multiplexing technologies such as MULTI-seq and antibody hashing using single-cell multiplexing kit (SCMK) reagents (BD Biosciences) use sample-specific sequence tags to enable individual samples to be sequenced in a pooled format, markedly lowering per-sample processing and sequencing costs while minimizing technical artifacts. Critically, however, pooling samples could introduce new artifacts, partially negating the benefits of sample multiplexing. In particular, no study to date has evaluated whether pooling peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from unrelated donors under standard scRNA-seq sample preparation conditions (e.g., 30 min co-incubation at 4  degrees C) results in significant changes in gene expression resulting from alloreactivity (i.e., response to non-self). The ability to demonstrate minimal to no alloreactivity is crucial to avoid confounded data analyses, particularly for cross-sectional studies evaluating changes in immunologic gene signatures. RESULTS: Here, we applied the 10x Genomics scRNA-seq platform to MULTI-seq and/or SCMK-labeled PBMCs from a single donor with and without pooling with PBMCs from unrelated donors for 30 min at 4  degrees C. We did not detect any alloreactivity signal between mixed and unmixed PBMCs across a variety of metrics, including alloreactivity marker gene expression in CD4+ T cells, cell type proportion shifts, and global gene expression profile comparisons using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Jensen-Shannon Divergence. These results were additionally mirrored in publicly-available scRNA-seq data generated using a similar experimental design. Moreover, we identified confounding gene expression signatures linked to PBMC preparation method (e.g., Trima apheresis), as well as SCMK sample classification biases against activated CD4+ T cells which were recapitulated in two other SCMK-incorporating scRNA-seq datasets. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that (i) mixing PBMCs from unrelated donors under standard scRNA-seq sample preparation conditions (e.g., 30 min co-incubation at 4  degrees C) does not cause an allogeneic response, and (ii) that Trima apheresis and PBMC sample multiplexing using SCMK reagents can introduce undesirable technical artifacts into scRNA-seq data.

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify variation in the response to influenza infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from European- and African-ancestry males. Genetic ancestry effects are common but highly cell type specific. Higher levels of European ancestry are associated with increased type I interferon pathway activity in early infection, which predicts reduced viral titers at later time points. Substantial population-associated variation is explained by cis-expression quantitative trait loci that are differentiated by genetic ancestry.

In addition to traditional risk factors, immune responses to co-infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) may play an unappreciated role in cardiometabolic comorbidities and offer new potential therapeutic targets in a subgroup of individuals. We assessed the relationship of CX3CR1(+), GPR56(+), and CD57(+/-) T cells (termed CGC(+)) with comorbid conditions in a cohort of 134 PWH co-infected with CMV on long-term ART. We found that PWH with cardiometabolic diseases (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, calcified coronary arteries, or diabetes) had higher circulating CGC(+)CD4(+) T cells compared to metabolically healthy PWH. The traditional risk factor most correlated with CGC(+)CD4(+) T cell frequency was fasting blood glucose, as well as starch/sucrose metabolites. While unstimulated CGC(+)CD4(+) T cells, like other memory T cells, depend on oxidative phosphorylation for energy, they exhibited higher expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A compared to other CD4(+) T cell subsets, suggesting a potentially greater capacity for fatty acid beta-oxidation. Lastly, we show that CMV-specific T cells against multiple viral epitopes are predominantly CGC(+). Together, this study suggests that among PWH, CGC(+) CD4(+) T cells are frequently CMV-specific and are associated with diabetes, coronary arterial calcium, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Future studies should assess whether anti-CMV therapies could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk in some individuals.","Persons with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) have a higher incidence and prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases attributed, in part, to persistent inflammation despite viral suppression.

Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large.

Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq.

RESULTS: We identified 16 and 15 PBMC subgroups in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, respectively. Hemodialysis significantly suppressed the expression levels of T cell receptor (TCR) genes in CD4+ T cell subsets (e.g., TRAV4, CD45, CD3G, CD3D, CD3E) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) pathway-related genes in monocytes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1).

Longitudinal and cross-tissue TCR analyses indicate unintended expansion of alloreactive CD8(+) T cells induced by ICI therapy for cancer, coinciding with ICI-associated organ rejection.","Dunlap, Garrett S","Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation, and Immunity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.",Nat Commun,2023 Mar 21

The AXL(+)SIGLEC6(+) DC (ASDC) has been only recently identified in humans and has a high capability of T cell activation. Nevertheless, its contribution to CNS autoimmunity remains still obscure. Here, we aimed to identify the ASDC in diverse sample types from IDD patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A detailed analysis of DC subpopulations using single-cell transcriptomics for the paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of IDD patients (total n = 9) revealed that three subtypes of DCs (ASDCs, ACY3(+) DCs, and LAMP3(+) DCs) were overrepresented in CSF compared with their paired blood. Among these DCs, ASDCs were also more abundant in CSF of IDD patients than in controls, manifesting poly-adhesional and stimulatory characteristics. In the brain biopsied tissues of IDD patients, obtained at the acute attack of disease, ASDC were also frequently found in close contact with T cells. Lastly, the frequency of ASDC was found to be temporally more abundant in acute attack of disease both in CSF samples of IDD patients and in tissues of EAE, an animal model for CNS autoimmunity.

We used a combination of imaging, single cell, and surgical approaches to identify a CD69(+) CD4 T cell population in both the mouse and human brain, distinct from circulating CD4 T cells. The brain-resident population was derived through in situ differentiation from activated circulatory cells and was shaped by self-antigen and the peripheral microbiome.

We estimated genetic ancestry (quantified as the proportion of African ancestry, or pAFR) by ADMIXTURE and correlated APOL1 genotypes and pAFR with outcomes.

To generate an ARDS risk score, we identified upregulation of 29 genes in the monocytes of these patients, and 17 showed a similar profile in cells of patients in independent cohorts. Monocytes had increased expression of RAB11A, known to inhibit neutrophil efferocytosis; ATP2B1, a calcium pump that exports Ca2+ implicated in endothelial barrier disruption; and SPARC, associated with processing of procollagen to collagen. These data show that monocytes of ARDS patients upregulate expression of genes not just restricted to those associated with inflammation.

Elucidating the interplay between COVID-19 and sepsis, particularly in geriatric patients suffering from sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is of paramount importance for identifying potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate hospitalization and mortality risks. METHODS: We employed bioinformatics and systems biology approaches to identify hub genes, shared pathways, molecular biomarkers, and candidate therapeutics for managing sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as co-existing or sequentially occurring infections. We corroborated these hub genes utilizing murine sepsis-ARDS models and blood samples derived from geriatric patients afflicted by sepsis-induced ARDS. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed 189 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared among COVID-19 and sepsis datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network, unearthing pivotal hub genes and modules. Notably, nine hub genes displayed significant alterations and correlations with critical inflammatory mediators of pulmonary injury in murine septic lungs. Simultaneously, 12 displayed significant changes and correlations with a neutrophil-recruiting chemokine in geriatric patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.

36569942,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1054422,"BACKGROUND: Netherton syndrome is a rare, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder with no effective treatment yet. Skin barrier dysfunction caused by SPINK5 gene mutations is a hallmark of the disease. Antigen penetration through the defective skin and nonspecific inflammation provide a pro-T helper 2 (Th2) immune microenvironment in the disease. Therefore, Th2 cytokines are considered to be candidate therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical responses of patients with Netherton syndrome to dupilumab, an IL-4Ralpha antagonist, and identify changes in the Th1/2/17 pathway activity, skin barrier defect protein LEKTI expression after treatment. METHODS: Four children with severe Netherton syndrome (aged 2 y to 4 y and 6 m) who were treated with dupilumab from January to June 2022 were evaluated at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after the start of dupilumab administration. Treatment response was assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), and the Dermatitis Family Impact-questionnaire (DFI). Blood eosinophil counts, serum IgE levels and inflammatory cytokines were measured. The immunotyping of Th1/2/17 cells was performed by flow cytometry and cytokine expressions in T cell subsets were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing. In addition, expression of the LEKTI in skin lesions was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: All four patients experienced clinical improvement, with significantly reduced EASI scores (by 75.0-83.9%) and NRS (by 87.5-90.0%) from baseline to 20 weeks of treatment. Improved quality of life scores were also seen for all patients, as measured by CDLQI and DFI. Serum IgE levels also fell by 75.6-86.9%. The serum Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were found at low level, with no significant changes during the treatment. However, Th2 cytokines expressed by T cells, especially IL-4, decreased at single-cell level after treatment (P = 0.029). The baseline percentage of Th2 cells (among total CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells) was significantly higher in patients than that in healthy controls (HC) (P &lt; 0.0001); this percentage fell from 8.25% +/- 0.75% to 4.02% +/- 0.62% after 20 weeks dupilumab treatment. There was no noticeable change in LEKTI protein expression in skin lesions pre- and post-treatment. Two patients reported mild ocular adverse effects, but there were no severe adverse events. CONCLUSION: Dupilumab may be an effective and safe treatment option in a subset of pediatric patients with Netherton syndrome, especially in improving itch and the quality of life. These effects were achieved in part by suppression of the Th2-mediated inflammation.","BACKGROUND: Netherton syndrome is a rare, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder with no effective treatment yet.

Despite therapeutic benefits, ICIs have the potential to cause immune-related adverse events such as myocarditis, a rare but serious side effect with up to 50% mortality in affected patients. Histologically, patients with ICI myocarditis have lymphocytic infiltrates in the heart, implicating T cell-mediated mechanisms. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular changes in ICI myocarditis are unknown. METHODS: To identify immune subset(s) associated with ICI myocarditis, we performed time-of-flight mass cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 52 individuals: 29 patients with autoimmune adverse events (immune-related adverse events) on ICI, including 8 patients with ICI myocarditis, and 23 healthy control subjects. We also used multiomics single-cell technology to immunophenotype 30 patients/control subjects using single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing with feature barcoding for surface marker expression confirmation. To correlate between the blood and the heart, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing/T-cell receptor sequencing/cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing on MRL/Pdcd1(-/-) (Murphy Roths large/programmed death-1-deficient) mice with spontaneous myocarditis. RESULTS: Using these complementary approaches, we found an expansion of cytotoxic CD8(+) T effector cells re-expressing CD45RA (Temra CD8(+) cells) in patients with ICI myocarditis compared with control subjects. T-cell receptor sequencing demonstrated that these CD8(+) Temra cells were clonally expanded in patients with myocarditis compared with control subjects. Transcriptomic analysis of these Temra CD8(+) clones confirmed a highly activated and cytotoxic phenotype. Longitudinal study demonstrated progression of these Temra CD8(+) cells into an exhausted phenotype 2 months after treatment with glucocorticoids. Differential expression analysis demonstrated elevated expression levels of proinflammatory chemokines (CCL5/CCL4/CCL4L2) in the clonally expanded Temra CD8(+) cells, and ligand receptor analysis demonstrated their interactions with innate immune cells, including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, as well as the absence of key anti-inflammatory signals. To complement the human study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing/T-cell receptor sequencing/cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing in Pdcd1(-/-) mice with spontaneous myocarditis and found analogous expansions of cytotoxic clonal effector CD8(+) cells in both blood and hearts of such mice compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal cytotoxic Temra CD8(+) cells are significantly increased in the blood of patients with ICI myocarditis, corresponding to an analogous increase in effector cytotoxic CD8(+) cells in the blood/hearts of Pdcd1(-/-) mice with myocarditis. These expanded effector CD8(+) cells have unique transcriptional changes, including upregulation of chemokines CCL5/CCL4/CCL4L2, which may serve as attractive diagnostic/therapeutic targets for reducing life-threatening cardiac immune-related adverse events in ICI-treated patients with cancer.","BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies used to activate the immune system against tumor cells.

We found that circulating cDC2s and their progenitors were significantly decreased in the blood of patients with PDAC, and repressed numbers of cDC2s were associated with poor prognosis. Serum cytokine analyses identified IL6 as significantly elevated in patients with PDAC and negatively correlated with cDC numbers. In vitro, IL6 impaired the differentiation of cDC1s and cDC2s from BM progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human cDC progenitors in the BM and blood of patients with PDAC showed an upregulation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway and a corresponding impairment of antigen processing and presentation.

METHODS: Here, we carried out comprehensive single-cell profiling of monocytes in paired blood samples of active TB (ATB) patients at diagnosis and mid-treatment, and healthy controls. RESULTS: At diagnosis, ATB patients displayed increased monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, increased frequency of CD14+CD16- and intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes, and upregulation of interferon signaling genes that significantly overlapped with previously reported blood TB signatures in both CD14+ subsets. In this cohort, we identified additional transcriptomic and functional changes in intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes, such as the upregulation of inflammatory and MHC-II genes, and increased capacity to activate T cells, reflecting overall increased activation in this population. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that distinct subsets of intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes were responsible for each gene signature, indicating significant functional heterogeneity within this population. Finally, we observed that changes in CD14+ monocytes were transient, as they were no longer observed in the same ATB patients mid-treatment, suggesting they are associated with disease resolution. DISCUSSION: Together, our study demonstrates for the first time that both intermediate and classical monocytes individually contribute to blood immune signatures of ATB and identifies novel subsets and associated gene signatures that may hold disease relevance.","INTRODUCTION: Previous studies suggest that monocytes are an important contributor to tuberculosis (TB)-specific immune signatures in blood.

In this strategy, the T cell genome is modified by the integration of lentiviral vectors encoding CAR that direct tumor cell killing. However, this therapeutic approach is often limited by the extent of CAR-T cell expansion in vivo. A major outstanding question is whether or not CAR-T integration itself enhances the proliferative competence of individual T cells by rewiring their regulatory landscape. To address this question, it is critical to define the identity of an individual CAR-T cell and simultaneously chart where the CAR-T vector integrates into the genome. Here, we report the development of a method called EpiVIA (https://github.com/VahediLab/epiVIA) for the joint profiling of the chromatin accessibility and lentiviral integration site analysis at the population and single-cell levels. We validate our technique in clonal cells with previously defined integration sites and further demonstrate the ability to measure lentiviral integration sites and chromatin accessibility of host and viral genomes at the single-cell resolution in CAR-T cells. We anticipate that EpiVIA will enable the single-cell deconstruction of gene regulation during CAR-T therapy, leading to the discovery of cellular factors associated with durable treatment.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T immunotherapy has yielded impressive results in several B cell malignancies, establishing itself as a powerful means to redirect the natural properties of T lymphocytes.

Although the importance of chronic periodontitis has been emphasized, the systemic immune response induced by periodontitis and its therapeutic effects remain elusive. Here, we report the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled PBMCs from healthy controls and paired pre- and post-treatment patients with periodontitis. We extracted differentially expressed genes and biological pathways for each cell type and calculated activity scores reflecting cellular characteristics. Intercellular crosstalk was classified into therapy-responsive and -nonresponsive pathways. RESULTS: We analyzed pan-cellular differentially expressed genes caused by periodontitis and found that most cell types showed a significant increase in CRIP1, which was further supported by the increased levels of plasma CRIP1 observed in patients with periodontitis. In addition, activated cell type-specific ligand-receptor interactions, including the BTLA, IFN-gamma, and RESISTIN pathways, were prominent in patients with periodontitis. Both the BTLA and IFN-gamma pathways returned to similar levels in healthy controls after periodontal therapy, whereas the RESISTIN pathway was still activated even after therapy. CONCLUSION: These data collectively provide insights into the transcriptome changes and molecular interactions that are responsive to periodontal treatment.

In this study, we applied targeted proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics to examine the differential immune landscape in SFTS patient blood. Serum immunoprofiling identified low-risk and high-risk clusters of SFTS patients based on inflammatory cytokine levels, which corresponded to disease severity. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of SFTS patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different infection stages showed pronounced expansion of B cells with alterations in B-cell subsets in fatal cases. Furthermore, plasma cells in which the interferon (IFN) pathway is downregulated were identified as the primary reservoir of SFTSV replication. This study identified not only the molecular signatures of serum inflammatory cytokines and B-cell lineage populations in SFTSV-induced fatalities but also plasma cells as the viral reservoir. Thus, this suggests that altered B-cell function is linked to lethality in SFTSV infections.IMPORTANCE SFTSV is an emerging virus discovered in China in 2009; it has since spread to other countries in East Asia. Although the fatality rates of SFTSV infection range from 5.3% to as high as 27%, the mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that SFTSV infection in fatal cases caused an excessive inflammatory response through high induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the aberrant inactivation of adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of SFTS patient PBMCs revealed that SFTSV targets the B-cell lineage population, especially plasma cells, as the potential viral reservoir in patients for whom the infection is fatal. Thus, SFTSV infection may inhibit high-affinity antibody maturation and secretion of plasma B cells, suppressing neutralizing antibody production and thereby allowing significant virus replication and subsequent fatality.","Dabie bandavirus (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV]) induces an immunopathogenic disease with a high fatality rate; however, the mechanisms underlying its clinical manifestations are largely unknown.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 12 kidney transplant recipients receiving pALG, and additional recipients receiving rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG), basiliximab, or no induction therapy as a comparison group. RESULTS: pALG showed high binding affinity to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after administration, immediately depleting blood lymphocytes; an effect that was weaker than rATG but stronger than basiliximab. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that pALG mainly influenced T cells and innate immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils). By analyzing immune cell subsets, we found that pALG moderately depleted CD4(+)T cells, CD8(+)T cells, regulatory T cells, and NKT cells and mildly inhibited dendritic cells. Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6) were only moderately increased compared with rATG, which might be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of untoward immune activation. During 3 months of follow-up, we found that all recipients and transplanted kidneys survived and showed good organ function recovery; there were no cases of rejection and a low rate of complications. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, pALG acts mainly by moderately depleting T cells and is thus a good candidate for induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients. The immunological features of pALG should be exploited for the development of individually-optimized induction therapies based on the needs of the transplant and the immune status of the patient, which is appropriate for non-high-risk recipients.","INTRODUCTION: Porcine anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (pALG) has been used in kidney transplantation, but its impacts on the lymphocyte cell pool remain unclear.

BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from extensive simulation studies and applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood, lung and skin cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals.","Sun, Zhe","Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.",Nat Commun,2019 Apr 9
36713435,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1090358,"BACKGROUND: Trauma-induced immune dysfunction has been a major barrier to achieving reduced mortality, which is poorly understood. Autophagy is a crucial catabolic mechanism of immune cells during times of stress. Few studies have investigated the immune regulatory effects induced by autophagy after trauma. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics analysis in a major trauma cohort to demonstrate the dominant role of autophagy in innate immune cells during the early stages of major trauma. METHOD: Single-cell transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed, which were sampled from three control participants and five major trauma patients within 6 hours of injury. In detail, after single-cell RNA-sequence data processing, cell type annotation and cluster marker identification were performed. A genetic toolbox with 604 autophagy-related genes was used to monitor the autophagy levels in immune cells. In addition, all transcriptome RNA sequencing data obtained from PBMCs in a cohort of 167 major trauma patients were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE36809). Key deregulated biological processes and important autophagic hub genes involved in immune cells were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis. RESULTS: A total of 20,445 differentially expressed genes were identified and five co-expression modules were constructed. Enrichment analysis indicated that activated autophagy is the most important biological process during the early stages of major trauma, and JMY (autophagy-related genes) were identified as hub genes. The single-cell transcriptional profiling of PBMCs demonstrated that all components of adaptive immune cells were significantly decreased, whereas components of innate immune cells (monocytes and neutrophils) were significantly increased in major trauma patients compared with control participants. Activated autophagy was detected in monocytes and neutrophils by monitoring the dynamic transcriptional signature of the autophagy-related genetic toolbox. Biological process analysis shows that antigen uptake, processing presentation, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II protein complex assembly pathways were up-regulated in autophagy-positive monocytes, whereas antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen and type I interferon signaling pathways were up-regulated in autophagy-positive neutrophils during the early stages of major trauma. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that autophagy is a biological process crucial to the development of immune disorders in the early stages of major trauma. Furthermore, the results of our study generated a comprehensive single-cell immune landscape for major trauma patients, in which we determined that autophagy profoundly affects the main functions of innate immune cells and provides insight into the cellular basis of immune dysregulation after major trauma.","BACKGROUND: Trauma-induced immune dysfunction has been a major barrier to achieving reduced mortality, which is poorly understood.

Here, we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single-cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA sequencing, we localize these cells in post mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes). FINDINGS: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/lymphotoxin beta (LTB)+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence, we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression.

METHODS: We have quantified the single-cell expression of 397 genes at the mRNA level and up to 68 proteins using oligo-conjugated antibodies (AbSeq) in 43,656 primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from the blood and 31,907 CD45(+) cells isolated from the blood and matched duodenal biopsies. We explored the sensitivity of this targeted scRNA-seq approach to dissect the heterogeneity of human immune cell populations and identify trajectories of functional T cell differentiation. RESULTS: We provide a high-resolution map of human primary CD4(+) T cells and identify precise trajectories of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation in the blood and tissue. The sensitivity provided by this multi-omics approach identified the expression of the B7 molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of CD4(+) Tregs, and we further demonstrated that B7 expression has the potential to identify recently activated T cells in circulation. Moreover, we identified a rare subset of CCR9(+) T cells in the blood with tissue-homing properties and expression of several immune checkpoint molecules, suggestive of a regulatory function. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic and proteomic hybrid technology described in this study provides a cost-effective solution to dissect the heterogeneity of immune cell populations at extremely high resolution. Unexpectedly, CD80 and CD86, normally expressed on antigen-presenting cells, were detected on a subset of activated Tregs, indicating a role for these co-stimulatory molecules in regulating the dynamics of CD4(+) T cell responses.","BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the transcriptomic and proteomic characterisation of CD4(+) T cells at the single-cell level has been performed by two largely exclusive types of technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and antibody-based cytometry.

Moreover, we identified a rare subset of CCR9(+) T cells in the blood with tissue-homing properties and expression of several immune checkpoint molecules, suggestive of a regulatory function. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptomic and proteomic hybrid technology described in this study provides a cost-effective solution to dissect the heterogeneity of immune cell populations at extremely high resolution. Unexpectedly, CD80 and CD86, normally expressed on antigen-presenting cells, were detected on a subset of activated Tregs, indicating a role for these co-stimulatory molecules in regulating the dynamics of CD4(+) T cell responses.","Trzupek, Dominik","Nuffield Department of Medicine, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.",Genome Med,2020 Jun 24
17190839,10.1084/jem.20061681,"The molecular events involved in the establishment and maintenance of CD4+ central memory and effector memory T cells (TCM and TEM, respectively) are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ex vivo isolated TCM are more resistant to both spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis than TEM and have an increased capacity to proliferate and persist in vitro. Using global gene expression profiling, single cell proteomics, and functional assays, we show that the survival of CD4+ TCM depends, at least in part, on the activation and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (STAT5a) and forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a). TCM showed a significant increase in the levels of phosphorylation of STAT5a compared with TEM in response to both IL-2 (P&lt;0.04) and IL-7 (P&lt;0.002); the latter is well known for its capacity to enhance T cell survival. Moreover, ex vivo TCM express higher levels of the transcriptionally inactive phosphorylated forms of FOXO3a and concomitantly lower levels of the proapoptotic FOXO3a target, Bim. Experiments aimed at blocking FOXO3a phosphorylation confirmed the role of this phosphoprotein in protecting TCM from apoptosis. Our results provide, for the first time in humans, an insight into molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for the longevity and persistence of CD4+ TCM.","The molecular events involved in the establishment and maintenance of CD4+ central memory and effector memory T cells (TCM and TEM, respectively) are poorly understood.

However, the B cell subtype(s) responsible for production of IgE to alpha-gal and mechanisms mediating this production remain elusive. Methods: Single cell multi-omics sequencing, was utilized to phenotype B cells obtained from 60 subjects that had undergone coronary angiography in whom serum IgE was evaluated by ImmunoCAP. Bioinformatics approaches were used to identify B cell subtype(s) and transcriptomic signatures associated with alpha-gal sensitization. In vitro characterization of chemokine/chemokine receptor pairs on switched memory B cells associated with IgE to alpha-gal was performed. Results: Of the 60 patients, 17 (28%) were positive for IgE to alpha-gal. CITESeq identified CCR6+ class-switched memory (SWM) B cells and CXCR4 expresssion on these CCR6+ SWM B cells as significantly associated with IgE sensitization to alpha-gal but not to other common allergens (peanut or inhalants). In vitro studies of enriched human B cells revealed significantly greater IgE on SWM B cells with high CCR6 and CXCR4 expression 10 days after cells were treated with IL-4 and CD40 to stimulate class switch recombination. Both CCL20 (CCR6 ligand) and CXCL12 (ligand for CXCR4) increased the expression of IgE on SWM B cells expressing their receptors. However, they appeared to have unique pathways mediating this effect as only CCL20 increased activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), while CXCL12 drove proliferation of CXCR4+ SWM B cells. Lastly, correlation analysis indicated an association between CAD severity and the frequency of both CCR6+ SWM and CXCR4+ SWM B cells. Conclusions: CCR6+ SWM B cells were identified as potential producers of IgE to alpha-gal in CAD patients.

Forced immunization with F. prausnitzii in rabbits was conducted. To screen for potential IgA-reactive proteins in F. prausnitzii lysates, we performed western blotting and mass spectrometry analyses. Pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) was cloned and purified, then the immunoreactivity of PFOR was verified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through PCR, ELISpot assay and single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq). Finally, the UC fecal dysbiosis was re-analyzed in the context of the phylogenetic tree of PFOR. RESULTS: F. prausnitzii was underrepresented in UC patients with elevated F. prausnitzii-reactive IgA in the fecal supernatant. Forced immunization with F. prausnitzii in rabbits led to high interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) transcription in the colon, along with beta diversity disturbance and intestinal inflammation. PFOR was identified as an IgA-binding antigen of F. prausnitzii and the immunoreactivity was validated in PBMCs, which showed elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines. The scRNA-seq revealed enhanced signals in both T regulatory cells (Tregs) and monocytes after PFOR incubation. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that PFOR was a common but conserved protein among the gut bacteria. DISCUSSION: Our results collectively suggest that PFOR is a bioactive protein in the immune system and may contribute to host-microbial crosstalk. Conserved but bioactive microbial proteins, such as PFOR, warrant more attention in future host-microbial interaction studies.","INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are associated with both immune abnormalities and dysbiosis, characterized by a loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii).

Furthermore, we performed bioinformatics analysis by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to identify prognostic biomarkers simultaneously overexpressed in the blood and tumor tissues of patients with HCC. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed 5 NK cell subsets (L1-NK-CD56(bright), L2-NK-CD56(dim), L3-NK-HLA, L4-LrNK-FCGR3A, and L5-LrNK-XCL1) in the healthy liver tissues.

Furthermore, we performed bioinformatics analysis by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to identify prognostic biomarkers simultaneously overexpressed in the blood and tumor tissues of patients with HCC. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed 5 NK cell subsets (L1-NK-CD56(bright), L2-NK-CD56(dim), L3-NK-HLA, L4-LrNK-FCGR3A, and L5-LrNK-XCL1) in the healthy liver tissues. However, the transitional L3 subset and the CXCR6(+)CD16(+) L4 subset with strong anti-tumor activity were absent in the HCC and peritumor liver tissues. Furthermore, 4 common prognosis-associated genes (RHOB, TALDO1, HLA-DPA1, and TKT) were significantly overexpressed in the paired tumor tissue and blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed 5 specific subsets of NK cells in healthy human liver tissues. However, only 3 of the 5 NK cell subsets were present in HCC and peritumor tissues. The cytotoxic NK cell subsets were absent in HCC tissues. Furthermore, we identified 4 potential non-invasive prognostic biomarkers in patients with HCC.","Liu, Huan","The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230001, China.",Cancer Biol Med,2022 Jul 21

Here, in 284 COVID-19 patients, we found IFN-I autoantibodies in 19% of critical, 6% of severe and none of the moderate cases. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 COVID-19 patients, 15 non-COVID-19 patients and 11 non-hospitalized healthy controls, revealed a lack of IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG-I) response in myeloid cells from critical cases, including those producing anti-IFN-I autoantibodies. Moreover, surface protein analysis showed an inverse correlation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 with ISG-I expression response early in the disease course. This aberrant ISG-I response in critical patients with and without IFN-I autoantibodies, supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression via convergent mechanisms.","Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies have been found in some critical COVID-19 patients; however, their prevalence and longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale, and functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown.

How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood, and the influence of stromal cells on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alterations of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naive tumors is characterized by the higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we found activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts, and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.","Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.

We revealed the skewed usage of the IGHV, IGLV and IGKV genes and identified a number of heavy or light chain VDJ gene pairs and combinational preference in each group, such as IGKV3-7 and IGKV2-24 enriched in the asymptomatic subjects, whereas IGHV3-13, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, IGHV1-18-IGLV3-19, IGHV1-18-IGLV3-21, and IGHV1-18-IGLV3-25 enriched in the recovery patients with severe diseases. We also observed the differential expression of IGHV3-23 in various B cell clusters by analysis of the scRNA-seq data. Additional dock analysis indicated that IGHV3-13 could bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These findings may advance our understanding of the humoral immune responses in COVID-19 patients and help develop novel vaccine candidates as well as therapeutical antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 infections.","B cell-mediated immune responses play important roles in controlling SARS-CoV infection.

However, further improvements are needed to increase response and cure rates. CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens have been limited to negative regulators of T cell functions(2-4) and raise safety concerns owing to the permanent modification of the genome. Here we identify positive regulators of T cell functions through overexpression of around 12,000 barcoded human open reading frames (ORFs). The top-ranked genes increased the proliferation and activation of primary human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and their secretion of key cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. In addition, we developed the single-cell genomics method OverCITE-seq for high-throughput quantification of the transcriptome and surface antigens in ORF-engineered T cells. The top-ranked ORF-lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTBR)-is typically expressed in myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes. When overexpressed in T cells, LTBR induced profound transcriptional and epigenomic remodelling, leading to increased T cell effector functions and resistance to exhaustion in chronic stimulation settings through constitutive activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. LTBR and other highly ranked genes improved the antigen-specific responses of chimeric antigen receptor T cells and gammadelta T cells, highlighting their potential for future cancer-agnostic therapies(5). Our results provide several strategies for improving next-generation T cell therapies by the induction of synthetic cell programmes.","The engineering of autologous patient T cells for adoptive cell therapies has revolutionized the treatment of several types of cancer(1).

Studies in patients have documented a decreased frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs and an increased frequency of Th17 cells in some patients with active disease. However, the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in STAT3 GOF syndrome remain largely unknown, and treatment is challenging. We developed a knock-in mouse model harboring a de novo pathogenic human STAT3 variant (p.G421R) and found these mice developed T cell dysregulation, lymphoproliferation, and CD4+ Th1 cell skewing. Surprisingly, Treg numbers, phenotype, and function remained largely intact; however, mice had a selective deficiency in the generation of iTregs. In parallel, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq on T cells from STAT3 GOF patients. We demonstrate only minor changes in the Treg transcriptional signature and an expanded, effector CD8+ T cell population. Together, these findings suggest that Tregs are not the primary driver of disease and highlight the importance of preclinical models in the study of disease mechanisms in rare PIRD.","Primary immune regulatory disorders (PIRD) represent a group of disorders characterized by immune dysregulation, presenting with a wide range of clinical disease, including autoimmunity, autoinflammation, or lymphoproliferation.

Although the activation process of normal T cells is well characterized, comparatively little is known about the activation of cells via the CAR. Here we have used flow cytometry together with single-cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the starting material (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and CAR therapeutic products of 3 healthy donors in the presence and absence of antigen-specific stimulation. Analysis of 53,191 single-cell transcriptomes showed APRIL-based CAR products to contain several subpopulations of cells, with cellular composition reproducible from donor to donor, and all major cellular subsets compatible with CAR expression. Only 50% of CAR-expressing cells displayed transcriptional changes upon CAR-specific antigen exposure. The resulting molecular signature for CAR T-cell activation provides a rich resource for future dissection of underlying mechanisms. Targeted data interrogation also revealed that a small proportion of antigen-responding CAR-expressing cells displayed an exhaustion signature, with both known markers and genes not previously associated with T-cell exhaustion. Comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus represents a powerful way to guide the assessment and optimization of clinical-grade CAR-T-cells, and inform future research into the underlying molecular processes.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell adoptive therapy is set to transform the treatment of a rapidly expanding range of malignancies.
